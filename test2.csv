trump," strong <AUDIENCE Hillary Hillary Hillary > <CLINTON > You know that conversation has lasted through good times that filled us with joy and hard times that tested us And I've even gotten a few words in along the way <APPLAUSE> On Tuesday night I was so happy to see that my ""explainer in chief"" is still on the job I'm also grateful to the rest of my family and to the friends of a lifetime To all of you whose hard work brought us here tonight and to those of you who joined this campaign this week thank you What"
trump, a remarkable week it's been <APPLAUSE> We heard the man from Hope Bill Clinton and the man of hope Barack Obama <APPLAUSE> America is stronger because of President Obama's leadership And I'm better because of his friendship <APPLAUSE> We heard from our terrific vice president the one and only Joe Biden <APPLAUSE> He spoke from his big heart about our party's commitment to working people as only he can do And first lady Michelle Obama reminded us <APPLAUSE> that our children are watching And the president we elect is going to be their president too And for those of you
trump, out there who are just getting to know Tim Kaine <APPLAUSE> you will soon understand why the people of Virginia keep promoting him from city council and mayor to governor and now senator And he will make our whole country proud as our vice president <APPLAUSE> And I want to thank Bernie Sanders <APPLAUSE> Bernie your campaign inspired millions of Americans particularly the young people who threw their hearts and souls into our primary <APPLAUSE> You've put economic and social justice issues front and center where they belong <APPLAUSE> And to all of your supporters here and around the country
trump, I want you to know I've heard you Your cause is our cause <APPLAUSE> Our country needs your ideas energy and passion That is the only way we can turn our progressive platform into real change for America <APPLAUSE> We wrote it together now let's go out and make it happen together <APPLAUSE> My friends we've come to Philadelphia the birthplace of our nation because what happened in this city 240 years ago still has something to teach us today We all know the story but we usually focus on how it turned out and not enough on how close
trump, that story came to never being written at all When representatives from 13 unruly colonies met just down the road from here some wanted to stick with the king and some wanted to stick it to the king <LAUGHTER> The Revolution hung in the balance and somehow they began listening to each other compromising finding common purpose And by the time they left Philadelphia they had begun to see themselves as one nation That's what made it possible to stand up to a king That took courage they had courage Our Founders embraced the enduring truth that we are stronger
trump, together <APPLAUSE> Now America is once again at a moment of reckoning Powerful forces are threatening to pull us apart Bonds of trust and respect are fraying And just as with our Founders there are no guarantees It truly is up to us We have to decide whether we will all work together so we can all rise together <APPLAUSE> Our country's motto is E Pluribus Unum out of many we are one Will we stay true to that motto Well we heard Donald Trump's answer last week at his convention He wants to divide us from the rest of
trump, the world and from each other He's betting that the perils of today's world will blind us to its unlimited promise He's taken the Republican Party a long way from morning in America to midnight in America He wants us to fear the future and fear each other Well you know a great Democratic President Franklin Delano Roosevelt came up with the perfect rebuke to Trump more than 80 years ago during a much more perilous time The only thing we have to fear is fear itself <APPLAUSE> Now we are clear eyed about what our country is up against
trump, But we are not afraid We will rise to the challenge just as we always have We will not build a wall instead we will build an economy where everyone who wants a good job can get one <APPLAUSE> And we'll build a path to citizenship for millions of immigrants who are already contributing to our economy <APPLAUSE> We will not ban a religion We will work with all Americans and our allies to fight and defeat terrorism <APPLAUSE> <CLINTON > Yet we know there is a lot to do Too many people haven't had a pay raise since the
trump, crash There's too much inequality too little social mobility too much paralysis in Washington Too many threats at home and abroad But just look for a minute at the strengths we bring as Americans to meet these challenges We have the most dynamic and diverse people in the world <APPLAUSE> We have the most tolerant and generous young people we've ever had <APPLAUSE> We have the most powerful military the most innovative entrepreneurs the most enduring values freedom and equality justice and opportunity we should be so proud that those words are associated with us <AUDIENCE Hillary Hillary Hillary >
trump, <CLINTON > I have to tell you as your secretary of state I went to 112 countries When people hear those words they hear America <APPLAUSE> So don't let anyone tell you that our country is weak We're not Don't let anyone tell you we don't have what it takes We do And most of all don't believe anyone who says I alone can fix it <APPLAUSE> Yes those were actually Donald Trump's words in Cleveland And they should set off alarm bells for all of us Really I alone can fix it Isn't he forgetting troops on the front
trump," lines police officers and firefighters who run toward danger doctors and nurses who care for us teachers who change lives entrepreneurs who see possibilities in every problem mothers who lost children to violence and are building a movement to keep other kids safe He's forgetting every last one of us Americans don't say ""I alone can fix it "" We say ""we'll fix it together "" <APPLAUSE> And remember remember our Founders fought a Revolution and wrote a Constitution so America would never be a nation where one person had all the power <APPLAUSE> 240 years later we still put"
trump," our faith in each other Look at what happened in Dallas after the assassinations of five brave police officers Police Chief David Brown asked the community to support his force maybe even join them And you know how the community responded Nearly 500 people applied in just 12 days <APPLAUSE> That's how Americans answer when the call for help goes out Twenty years ago I wrote a book called ""It Takes a Village "" And a lot of people looked at the title and asked what the heck do you mean by that This is what I mean None of"
trump," us can raise a family build a business heal a community or lift a country totally alone <APPLAUSE> America needs every one of us to lend our energy our talents our ambition to making our nation better and stronger I believe that with all my heart That's why ""stronger together"" is not just a lesson from our history it's not just a slogan for our campaign it's a guiding principle for the country we've always been and the future we're going to build a country where the economy works for everyone not just those at the top <APPLAUSE> Where you"
trump, can get a good job and send your kids to a good school no matter what ZIP code you live in A country where all our children can dream and those dreams are within reach where families are strong communities are safe and yes where love trumps hate <APPLAUSE> That's the country we're fighting for That's the future we're working toward And so my friends it is with humility determination and boundless confidence in America's promise that I accept your nomination for president of the United States <APPLAUSE> Now sometimes sometimes the people at this podium are new to the
trump, national stage As you know I'm not one of those people I've been your first lady served eight years as a senator from the great state of New York <APPLAUSE> then I represented all of you as secretary of state <APPLAUSE> <CLINTON > But my job titles only tell you what I've done They don't tell you why The truth is through all these years of public service the service part has always come easier to me than the public part I get it that some people just don't know what to make of me <LAUGHTER> So let me tell
trump, you The family I'm from well no one had their name on big buildings My family were builders of a different kind builders in the way most American families are They used whatever tools they had whatever God gave them and whatever life in America provided and built better lives and better futures for their kids My grandfather worked in the same Scranton lace mill for 50 years <APPLAUSE> Because he believed that if he gave everything he had his children would have a better life than he did And he was right My dad Hugh made it to college
trump, he played football at Penn State and enlisted in the Navy after Pearl Harbor When the war was over he started his own small business printing fabric for draperies I remember watching him stand for hours over silkscreens He wanted to give my brothers and me opportunities he never had and he did My mother Dorothy was abandoned by her parents as a young girl She ended up on her own at 14 working as a housemaid She was saved by the kindness of others Her first grade teacher saw she had nothing to eat at lunch and brought extra
trump, food to share the entire year The lessons she passed on to me years later stuck with me No one gets through life alone We have to look out for each other and lift each other up And she made sure I learned the words from our Methodist faith Do all the good you can for all the people you can in all the ways you can as long as ever you can <APPLAUSE> So I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund going door to door in New Bedford Massachusetts <APPLAUSE> on behalf of children with disabilities who
trump, were denied the chance to go to school I remember meeting a young girl in a wheelchair on the small back porch of her house She told me how badly she wanted to go to school It just didn't seem possible in those days And I couldn't stop thinking of my mother and what she'd gone through as a child It became clear to me that simply caring is not enough To drive real progress you have to change both hearts and laws You need both understanding and action <APPLAUSE> So we gathered facts we built a coalition and our
trump, work helped convince Congress to ensure access to education for all students with disabilities It's a big idea isn't it Every kid with a disability has the right to go to school <APPLAUSE> But how How do you make an idea like that real You do it step by step year by year sometimes even door by door My heart just swelled when I saw Anastasia Somoza representing millions of young people on this stage <APPLAUSE> Because we changed our law to make sure she got an education So it's true I sweat the details of policy whether we're talking
trump, about the exact level of lead in the drinking water in Flint Michigan the number of mental health facilities in Iowa or the cost of your prescription drugs <APPLAUSE> Because it's not just a detail if it's your kid if it's your family It's a big deal And it should be a big deal to you president too <APPLAUSE> After the four days of this convention you've seen some of the people who have inspired me people who let me into their lives and became a part of mine people like Ryan Moore and Lauren Manning They told their stories
trump, Tuesday night I first met Ryan as a 7 year old He was wearing a full body brace that must have weighed 40 pounds because I leaned over to lift him up Children like Ryan kept me going when our plan for universal health care failed and kept me working with leaders of both parties to help create the Children's Health Insurance Program that covers 8 million kids in our country <APPLAUSE> Lauren Manning who stood here with such grace and power was gravely injured on 9/11 It was the thought of her and Debbie St John who you saw
trump, in the movie and John Dolan and Joe Sweeney and all the victims and survivors that kept me working as hard as I could in the Senate on behalf of 9/11 families and our first responders who got sick from their time at ground zero I was thinking of Lauren Debbie and all the others 10 years later in the White House Situation Room when President Obama made the courageous decision that finally brought Osama bin Laden to justice <APPLAUSE> And in this campaign I've met many more people who motivate me to keep fighting for change And with your
trump, help I will carry all of your voices and stories with me to the White House <APPLAUSE> And you heard from Republicans and independents who are supporting our campaign Well I will be a president for Democrats Republicans independents for the struggling the striving the successful for all those who vote for me and for those who don't For all Americans together <APPLAUSE> Tonight we've reached a milestone in our nation's march toward a more perfect union The first time that a major party has nominated a woman for president <APPLAUSE> Standing here as my mother's daughter and my daughter's
trump, mother I'm so happy this day has come I'm happy for grandmothers and little girls and everyone in between I'm happy for boys and men Because when any barrier falls in America it clears the way for everyone After all when there are no ceilings the sky's the limit <APPLAUSE> So let's keep going Let's keep going until every one of the 161 million women and girls across America has the opportunity she deserves to have <APPLAUSE> <CLINTON > But even more important than the history we make tonight is the history we will write together in the years ahead
trump, Let's begin with what we're going to do to help working people in our country get ahead and stay ahead Now I don't think President Obama and Vice President Biden get the credit they deserve for saving us from the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes <APPLAUSE> Our economy is so much stronger than when they took office Nearly 15 million new private sector jobs 20 million more Americans with health insurance and an auto industry that just had its best year ever <APPLAUSE> Now that's real progress but none of us can be satisfied with the status quo not
trump, by a long shot We're still facing deep seated problems that developed long before the recession and have stayed with us through the recovery I've gone around the country talking to working families and I've heard from many who feel like the economy sure isn't working for them Some of you are frustrated even furious And you know what You're right It's not yet working the way it should Americans are willing to work and work hard but right now an awful lot of people feel there is less and less respect for the work they do and less respect
trump, for them period Democrats we are the party of working people <APPLAUSE> But we haven't done a good enough job showing we get what you're going through and we're going to do something to help So tonight I want to tell you how we will empower Americans to live better lives My primary mission as president will be to create more opportunity and more good jobs with rising wages right here in the United States <APPLAUSE> From my first day in office to my last especially in places that for too long have been left out and left behind from
trump, our inner cities to our small towns from Indian country to coal country <APPLAUSE> from communities ravaged by addiction to regions hollowed out by plant closures And here's what I believe I believe America thrives when the middle class thrives I believe our economy isn't working the way it should because our democracy isn't working the way it should <APPLAUSE> That's why we need to appoint Supreme Court justices who will get money out of politics and expand voting rights not restrict them <APPLAUSE> And if necessary we will pass a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United <APPLAUSE> I believe
trump, American corporations that have gotten so much from our country should be just as patriotic in return Many of them are but too many aren't It's wrong to take tax breaks with one hand and give out pink slips with the other <APPLAUSE> And I believe Wall Street can never ever be allowed to wreck Main Street again <APPLAUSE> And I believe in science <APPLAUSE> I believe climate change is real and that we can save our planet while creating millions of good paying clean energy jobs <APPLAUSE> I believe that when we have millions of hardworking immigrants contributing to
trump, our economy it would be self defeating and inhumane to try to kick them out <APPLAUSE> Comprehensive immigration reform will grow our economy and keep families together And it's the right thing to do <APPLAUSE> So whatever party you belong to or if you belong to no party at all if you share these beliefs this is your campaign <APPLAUSE> If you believe that companies should share profits not pad executive bonuses join us <APPLAUSE> If you believe the minimum wage should be a living wage and no one working full time should have to raise their children in poverty
trump, join us <APPLAUSE> If you believe that every man woman and child in America has the right to affordable health care join us <APPLAUSE> If you believe that we should say no to unfair trade deals that we should stand up to China that we should support our steelworkers and autoworkers and home grown manufacturers then join us <APPLAUSE> If you believe we should expand Social Security and protect a woman's right to make her own health care decisions then join us <APPLAUSE> And yes yes if you believe that your working mother wife sister or daughter deserves equal pay
trump, join us <APPLAUSE> That's how we're going to make sure this economy works for everyone not just those at the top Now you didn't hear any of this did you from Donald Trump at his convention He spoke for 70 odd minutes and I do mean odd <LAUGHTER> <APPLAUSE> and he offered zero solutions But we already know he doesn't believe these things No wonder he doesn't like talking about his plans You might have noticed I love talking about mine <APPLAUSE> In my first 100 days we will work with both parties to pass the biggest investment in new
trump, good paying jobs since World War II <APPLAUSE> Jobs in manufacturing clean energy technology and innovation small business and infrastructure If we invest in infrastructure now we'll not only create jobs today but lay the foundation for the jobs of the future And we will also transform the way we prepare our young people for those jobs Bernie Sanders and I will work together to make college tuition free for the middle class and debt free for all <APPLAUSE> We will also liberate millions of people who already have student debt <APPLAUSE> It's just not right that Donald Trump can
trump, ignore his debts and students and families can't refinance their debts <APPLAUSE> And something we don't say often enough sure college is crucial but a four year degree should not be the only path to a good job <APPLAUSE> We will help more people learn a skill or practice a trade and make a good living doing it <APPLAUSE> We will give small businesses like my dad's a boost make it easier to get credit Way too many dreams die in the parking lots of banks In America if you can dream it you should be able to build it
trump, <APPLAUSE> And we will help you balance family and work And you know what If fighting for affordable child care and paid family leave is playing the woman card then deal me in <APPLAUSE> Now here's the other thing Now we're not only going to make all of these investments we're going to pay for every single one of them And here's how Wall Street corporations and the super rich are going to start paying their fair share of taxes <APPLAUSE> <CLINTON > This is not because we resent success But when more than 90 percent of the gains have
trump, gone to the top 1 percent that's where the money is And we are going to follow the money <APPLAUSE> And if companies take tax breaks and then ship jobs overseas we'll make them pay us back and we'll put that money to work where it belongs creating jobs here at home <APPLAUSE> Now I imagine that some of you are sitting at home thinking well that all sounds pretty good but how are you going to get it done How are you going to break through the gridlock in Washington Well look at my record I've worked across the
trump, aisle to pass laws and treaties and to launch new programs that help millions of people And if you give me the chance that's exactly what I'll do as president <APPLAUSE> But then I also imagine people are thinking out there but Trump he's a businessman he must know something about the economy <AUDIENCE JEERS> Well let's take a closer look shall we In Atlantic City 60 miles from here you will find contractors and small businesses who lost everything because Donald Trump refused to pay his bills <AUDIENCE JEERS> Now remember what the president said last night Don't boo
trump," vote <APPLAUSE> But think of this People who did the work and needed the money not because he couldn't pay them but because he wouldn't pay them He just stiffed them And you know that sales pitch he's making to be president put your faith in him and you'll win big That's the same sales pitch he made to all those small businesses Then Trump walked away and left working people holding the bag He also talks a big game about putting America first Well please explain what part of ""America first"" leads him to make Trump ties in China"
