 presidential candidate   and  vice presidential candidate sen   dva hold a rally before embar on a jobsfocused bus tour across pennsylvania and ohio

 good morning philadelphia   wow man wow i  i was tired after last night but i'm awake now  listen what a warm welcome hello to philadelphia you know i'll tell you we come from virginia and we think we have this hospitality thing down pat but philadelphia really showed off this week  so some thank yous i want to thank my great friend and senate colleague bob casey what a wonderful  what a wonderful public servant  and we are so exci to have another great pennsylvanian about to join us in the uni states senate katie mcginty katie  you have heard earlier today already from two of the people who are absolutely key to ma this convention work like a charm and that's our congressman bob y and mayor  kenney thank you guys for all your great work  governor ed rendell he and i share being mayors governors and dnc chairs we surely have e  we get to go right by purgatory and right through the golden  because of what we've done  ed rendell great  great public servant  we have  in the preprogram you've already heard from councilwoman cherelle parker and reverend bonnie camarda and  hill and josh shapiro so many great public servants broadly defined  in this room  it has been an incredible week and i could not be prouder to be here in philadelphia and accept the request of a spectacular public servant   to accept my party's nomination to be the next president 
  
 i  i shared  i shared the other night at the convention how kind of weird i feel being here i mean i just grew up in such a nonpolitical household my dad ran this union organized iron workers  and mom and dad are here somewhere in this room they're yearsold and we're having a great e together  and i don't know if there's any irishamans here but they're standing with a buddy  they're standing with a buddy from county cork  fleming who flew over to surprise me so look we're  we're here as a strong family all of us we worked in my dad's business my mom and my brothers and me and pitched in that's what family businesses do i know a lot of you come from that when family says you've got to help you've got to help and we like helping i learned a lot from wor for my dad i learned a lot from a jesuit high school i went to that taught  wow jesuits aren't that big an applause line in every city but i'm glad  i'm glad to know in philadelphia  i'm glad to know in philadelphia  i bet there were a lot of pope francis catholics here before there was a pope francis  but  but those values of  of hard work and of faith were my guiding principles and that's one of the reasons that i developed such an admiration and friendship for   because those are the e values that has driven her her growing up in a small business household or growing up inspired by a methodist youth pastor those are her values and  and she's been living them fighting for kids and families putting them first for her entire career her entire career  in  in my own life i took the lessons from my parents and i took the lessons from the jesuits that i worked with as a missionary in honduras and i basically decided to do what virtually all of you guys are doing which is to measure what i do by how it helped somebody else can you serve others can you do good for others it's not about title it's not about money it's not about prestige it's not about popularity it's not about anything other than serving other people and that's the kind of candidate we have  so we're starting today this  this bus tour now this is the part of the campaign i really like i mean you know the big  the big events are fun but i don't like wearing a tie that much  so i'd rather  i'd rather just go out and pound the pavement so we're starting a threeday bus tour today and this is the first rally and then we're going to go  and it's not accident this is the first rally and then we're going to go across pennsylvania and we're going to go across iowa and secretary  is going to be laying out why she is going to be such a fantastic president  a fantastic president  we're going to be drawing that contrast between  's plans for our country and  's empty promises and no plans for the country you  you  you know  you know her plans i mean i don't know is there anybody at temple that likes the idea of debtfree college i mean  she has pledged in the first  days of the administration to make a massive investment in new jobs education work training rebuilding our nation's infrastructure fighting the battles that she has fought e and e again and it's not just about what she says it's that she has delivered i know you watched last night as she talked about  and  and  and as  talked about  her battling to get health insurance for eight million aman kids when she was first lady  now don't you want  don't you want a president who knows how to battle and get things done for regular people who might not be able to get those things done without a great champion  of course you do of course you do so that is what we'll do over the next couple of days and we'll talk about creating jobs we'll talk about raising wages we'll talk about the leadership that ama needs to play in the world  a leadership that has got to be based on alliances and building bridges and  and just using the relationships we have to defeat forces of terrorism and forces of prejudice forces of antisemitism we can do that when we work together around the world  and finally  and finally and in some ways this is the thing that matters the most to me as a former civil rights lawyers the  we want to make sure that we've got a community of respect  right a  or as the civil rights leaders used to say a beloved community where  where people are not demeaned because of who they are not  not dissed because of they're somebody with a disability or they're lgbt or they come from another country or their skin color is different or they speak a different language but embraced hey don't you guys in pennsylvania call yourself a common wealth just like we in virginia do you know just like we in virginia do  that's different than saying you're a state anybody who says we're a common wealth what you're saying is the wealth we hold we hold in common it has got to be about everybody it has got to be about bringing everybody together and those are  's values  now the last thing i'll say before we bring up our champion and the main event is  i've noticed there's a few differences between   and   now let's see what's today  what's today friday i think i can  well i'm going to try to boil it down you've seen  basically pitch in a very dark and negative in cleveland a very different view of this country weren't you proud of how opistic upbeat positive proama the convention was here and the message  was here  absolutely absolutely  the  convention was like a twis and negative tour it wasn't a tour of this country it was a journey through  's mind and that is very frightening place that is a very frightening place  when it comes to the economy we're at a college  we're at a college can i ask you a question in  we've got a you're hired president would you rather have that or a you're fired president  absolutely that's not that hard that's not that hard in  you've got a bridge builder would you rather have that or have a trash talker a bridge builder right a bridge builder  and in  you've got that character from before she was ever in office to put kids and families first this is really important this is really important if you want to know about trustworthiness and character somebody in public life look to see  all right he got to the punch line he got to the punch line he got to the punch line  i like you i like you  all right  all right now look  if you want to know how you can view somebody in public life look to see if they had a passion before they got in office and whether they have continued that passion consistently throughout their entire e and you know that   in good es and tough es in victory and defeat through hell or high water in office or out of office since she was a teenager has been putting kids and families first and you also know that   has had a passion too and that passion is     so it's kids first or me first but look i am so glad to be on this ticket it's a history ma ticket anything i can do to help us succeed and anything i can do that will help this administration be a fantastic one from first day to last is going to be my humble honor to do so please a great philadelphia pennsylvania aman welcome to our next president   
 hello thank you whoa thank you all so much thank you  thank you very very much i have to begin by than our host the people of philadelphia  you know a little something about history and about ma history and i am so grateful to everyone in this city who hold such a great convention together who were so gracious welcoming and hospitable and i am thrilled that so many amans from everywhere got a chance to see philadelphia to see what's in this great city  people kept coming back from going for walks going to museums going to other sites telling me how much they were impressed and so i want to thank your mayor thank you mayor kenney  i want to thank your congressman who tried to come home to philadelphia every day and i know why because he loves this city bob y   i am always happy to be here with someone who's been a friend for  and me over so many years an extraordinary public servant and advocate former governor and mayor ed rendell  now i like  i had the great pleasure of serving in the senate with senator bob casey and i apprecia his tenacity the attention to detail the work he did for you every single day and so i want to thank bob and i want also to recognize who i  will be his partner in the senate come november katie mcginty  and i  the next attorney general for the commonwealth of pennsylvania josh shapiro  this has been such an vigorating exciting week as i said last night we heard from the man from     and we heard from the man of     and i was so exci to introduce to ama our partners it  its going to be fun to travel with both  and ann because they  they are going to demonstrate to the country what the people of virginia already know there's no better people to have in your corner than   and ann holten  now i  i don't know about you but i  i stayed up really late last night it was just hard to go to sleep we  oh thank you thank you it  it was so exciting and but i  i have to tell you it was also kind of overwhelming i  i take deeply and with great humility the responsibility that this great campaign imposes on us there is no doubt in my mind that every election in our democracy is important in it's own way but i cant think of an election that is more important certainly in my lifee and its not so much that i am on the ticket it is because of the stark choice that is posed to ama in this election so when i did  when i did wake up this morning  thank you  when i  when i  when i did  did start moving and  and i star drin our coffee or as that it be administered through an iv  laughter  we suddenly looked at each other and we realized as of tomorrow we have  days to make our case to ama  so what better place to kick off this campaign than right here in philadelphia where it all star  years ago i  i believe with all my heart that our founders came together to create one nation because they understood what we understand we are stronger together  and  and as we poin out during our four great days of our convention you heard something very different from the s didn't you we  we might as well have been tal about two different countries or as someone said to me two different planets   pain a picture a negative dark divisive picture of a country in decline he insis that ama is weak and he told us all after laying out this very dark picture that i alone can fix it now as i  as i watched and heard that it set off alarm bells because just think about what happened here  years ago think about our founders coming together a declaration of independence writing a constitution they set up our form of government the longestlasting democracy in the history of the world  and you know they did it they did it  they did it because they knew they didn't want one person one man to have all the power like a  and think about  washington our first president after he served he stepped down voluntarily people around him couldn't believe it but he said no this is the example we should set a democracy requires something from all of us not just people we elect but every single one of us and washington set that example and i don't know any founder no matter how  how strong they were how smart they were who believed that only they could solve our problems so
   
 and i'll tell you something else
   
 i'll tell  i'll tell you something else they also expec a kind of raucous debate in ama but at the end of the debate we have to come together and get things done don't we  so as  said we are going to get on a bus as soon as we leave here and we're going to drive through pennsylvania and into ohio it's kind of nostalgic for me my dad was born in scranton i spent every summer of my life up in northeast pennsylvania my father my brother went to penn state so i know  i  i know how beautiful this commonwealth is and how wonderful the people are but we've got work to do i'm not satisfied with the status quo i'm not telling you that everything is just peachy keen i'm telling you we've made progress but we have work to do if we're going to make sure everybody is included  and  and you know i think that we've got to have more good jobs we've got to raise wages we've got to tackle inequality we've got to make this economy work for everyone not just those at the top  and  and if you listened really closely to the  convention you know that   talked for  minutes and did not offer one solution in fact his  his speech his whole convention seemed more about insulting me instead of helping the aman people  so here's what i've said i will do and we're going to get to work on the very first day within the first  days of our administration we're going to break through the gridlock in washington and make the biggest investment in new goodpaying jobs since world war ii  we're going to do it in infrastructure technology clean energy advanced manufacturing  and i'm also going to pay special attention to those parts of our country that have been left out and left behind from our inner cities to our small towns from indian country to coal country from communities ravaged by addiction and places hallowed out by plant closures anybody willing to work in ama should be able to find a job to get ahead and stay ahead that's my goal  so on our bus tour we're going to be visiting a few places where people are ma things i find it highly amusing that   talks about make ama great again he doesn't make a thing in ama except bankruptcies  so there's a lot to be done my friends and i'm exci i'm exci to have  and anne as part of this team and i'm exci to have the nd president of the uni states as part of this team  the four of us are going to barnstorm the country because as a very smart president who just so happens to be here today once said there is nothing wrong with ama that can't be cured by what's right with ama  so now we had a great convention but we've got to go out and we've got to fight for our vision of the future and i can't do it alone i need each and every one of you here's what i'd ask you to do please join us go to com or text join  join  to  to be part of this campaign and we are hiring organizers here in pennsylvania and across the country  and between now and election day we are going to register three million more people  and we're not just going to register them we're going to get them to commit to vote  we feel deeply the responsibility for continuing the work that star down the road from here  years ago now nobody who looks like me was thought to be possible to run for president back then no one who looked like   was thought to be possible  but contrary to   i believe every e we knock down a barrier in ama it liberates everyone in ama  i have to say last night after  after the end of our convention i knew  i knew that every parent in this country could look at their son or their daughter and now say the very e thing you too could be president of the uni states thank you all god bless you   delivers remarks on economic policy (sd)

 thank you thank you so much i have to tell you i am thrilled to be here for a number of reasons first back in michigan  it's wonderful to be back in michigan you can really feel the energy and dynamism that is driving this state to come back and in detroit we've got new businesses opening neighborhoods like midtown and eastern market are coming back the auto industry just had its best year ever  over in ann arbor high tech firms are thriving 
 the next generation of engineers are getting trained up in houghton and here at future amic so well named you are on the front lines of what i believe will be a true manufacturing renaissance in ama  i just was give a short but exciting tour by by mark jurcak and  couch who were telling me about how this company was star as and for most of its early history was an auto supply company and then in  as the market began to change and some of the auto companies began to realign they were faced with a choice we all face choices in life don't we and this company could have just said hey you know our business is not going to be what it was we've got to just fold up let's you know just kind of quit but that's not what happened here and what happened here is what can happen across ama you are in now what is largely an aerospace company and   because of the workforce and the work ethic and the commitment of futuramic you are seeing the future unfold so i got to see what's happening here to help build the sls rocket that is going to go from macomb to mars  i saw the two halves of an f nose cone waiting to be put together i talked with some of the workers about the absolute perfection that is required to do this work and what i believe with all my heart is that what's happening here can happen in so many places if we put our minds to it if we support advanced manufacturing if we are the kind of country that once again understands how important it is to build things we are builders and we need to get back to building  so we're ma progress none of us can be satisfied until the economic revitalization we're seeing in some parts of michigan reaches every community but it is inspiring to see this combination of old fashioned hard work and cutting edge innovation and i know my opponent in this election was here in michigan about a week ago and it was like he was in a different place when he visi detroit on monday he talked only of failure poverty and crime he is missing so much about what makes michigan great  and the e is true when it comes to our country he describes ama as an embarrassment he said and i quote we're becoming a thirdworld country look around you my friends go visit with the workers building rockets that doesn't happen in thirdworld countries  now we have a lot of urgent and important work to do and that's what i'm going to talk about today because all the people that i have met throughout this campaign really prove how wrong this negative pessimistic view is ama's best days are still ahead of us if we make up our minds to actually go out and make that happen  just consider our assets we have the most dynamic productive workforce in the world bar none  we have the most innovative businesses the top colleges universities community colleges training programs in the world and the best science and technologies we have enormous capacity for clean energy production we are resilient determined hardwor there is nothing ama can't do if we do it together
 and i  i know this because this is how i was raised and i don't think mr  understands any of it he hasn't offered any credible solutions for the very real economic challenges we face now those challenges emerged long before the great recession and they have persis through our recovery there is too much inequality too little upward mobility it is just too hard to get ahead today but there are common sense things that your government could do that would give amans more opportunities to succeed why don't we do it because powerful special interests and the tendency to put ideology ahead of political progress has led to gridlock in congress and how can you not be frustra and even angry when you see nothing getting done and a lot of people feel no one is on their side and no one has their back and that is not how it's supposed to be in ama if i am fortunate enough to be your president i will have your back every single day that i serve  and my mission in the white house will be to make our economy work for everyone not just those at the top this is personal for me i am the product of the aman middle class i was born in chicago i was raised in a suburb but my grandfather worked at the scranton lake mill in scranton pennsylvania for  years and because he worked hard my dad was able to go to college and eventually start his own small business and then send me out into the world to follow my own dreams no matter how far those dreams have taken me i have always remembered i am the daughter of a small business owner and the granddaughter of a factory worker and proud of both  so here's what i want i want every aman family to be able to tell the e story if you work hard you do your part you should be able to give your children all the opportunities they deserve that is the basic bargain of ama now whether we will be able to renew that bargain on even better terms for the st century depends in large measure on the outcome of this election so here are four questions that i  the aman people will ask of both candidates and that the answers should help make your choice in november crystal clear first which candidate has a real plan to create good paying jobs second who will restore fairness into our economy and ensure that those at the top pay their fair share of taxes  third who will really go to bat for wor families and fourth who can bring people together to deliver the results that will make a difference in your lives now  now i  that after giving a fair hearing to both sides you will join the millions of people across our country supporting this campaign not just s but a growing number of s and independents as well now when it comes to creating jobs i would argue it's not even close even conservative experts say 's agenda will pull our economy back into recession and according to an independent analysis by a former economic advisor to senator  mccain if you add up all of 's ideas from cutting taxes for the wealthy and corporations to starting a trade war with china to deporting millions of hardwor immigrants the result would be a loss of  million jobs now by contrast the e analyst found that with our plan the economy would create more than  million new jobs
 so let me tell you how we would do that i believe every aman willing to work hard should be able to find a job that provides dignity pride and decent pay that can support a family so starting on day one we will work with both parties to pass the biggest investment in new good paying jobs since world war ii  we will put amans to work building and modernizing our roads our bridges our tunnels our railways our ports our airports  we are way overdue for this my friends we are living off the investments that were made by our parents and grandparents generations we will also help cities like detroit and flint connect underserved neighborhoods to opportunity expanding affordable housing and we will repair schools and failing water systems as well  you know i happen to think we should be ambitious while we're at it let's connect every household in ama to broadband by the year   it's astonishing to me how many places in ama not way way far away from cities but in cities and near cities that don't have access to broadband and that disadvantages kids who are asked to do homework using the internet five million of them live in homes without access to the internet so you talk about an achievement gap it starts right there and let's build a cleaner more resilient power grid with enough renewable energy to power every home in our country as well  some country is going to be the clean energy super power of the st century and create millions of jobs and businesses it's probably going to be either china germany or ama i want it to be us we invent the technology we should make it and use it and export it which will help to grow our economy and here's something that you don't always hear enough of from s a big part of our plan will be unleashing the power of the private sector to create more jobs at higher pay and that means for us creating an infrastructure bank to get private funds off the sidelines and compliment our private investments twentyfive ion dollars in government seed funding could a lot more than $ ion and really get our country moving on our infrastructure plans and we're going to invest $ ion in what we're calling make it in ama partnerships to support aman manufacturing and recommit to scientific research that can create entire new industries 
 when mark and  were giving me the tour and i was tal to some of the workers along the way and as them where some of the precision machinery came from that is being used here at futuramic it what i hear all over the country germany japan italy i want to bring that precision manufacturing back to the uni states there is no reason we can't begin to make those machines ourselves and supply the rest of the world instead of buying from somewhere else let's also expand incentives like the new market tax credits that can bring businesses government and communities together to create good jobs in places that have been left out and left behind from neglec neighborhoods in detroit and flint to logging country coal country native aman communities from rural areas ravaged by addiction and lost jobs to industrial regions hollowed out when factories closed 
 as president i will also make a major push to empower small businesses and entrepreneurs with   with new national initiatives to cut red tape at every level and expand access to credit especially through community banks and credit unions i will propose a new plan to dramatically simplify tax filing for small businesses  right now the smallest businesses the kind that my dad had  it was a really small business  spent  es more per employee to prepare their taxes compared to larger companies it should be as easy as printing out a bank statement lets free entrepreneurs to do what they do best initiative grow and hire as mark said this company star because of a drive down a road and thin about it tal about it then seeing one of the old oldsmobile futuramics and deciding  hey not only do i have an idea i've got a name in ama if you can dream it you should be able to build it and we're going to get back to doing that  now   has a different view he's made a career out of stiffing small businesses from atlantic city to las vegas there are companies that were left hanging because he refused to pay their s a lot of those companies scraped together what they could to pay their employees and many of them put their businesses at risk and someone of them ended up ta bankruptcy it wasn't because  couldn't pay them it was because he wouldn't pay them and that's why i take it personally my dad ran a printing plant he had two really long tables he prin fabric for draperies he would lay out the fabric and then he would take a silk screen and he would go down the table he'd put the silk screen down and he'd pour the paint in he'd take the squeegee he'd go across the screen he'd lift it up he'd go down  go down all the way to the end and then he would start on the other table he worked hard and then when he finished he would load all that fabric up put it in his car and take it to the business that had ordered it maybe a restaurant or a hotel or some office he expec to be paid when he showed up he did the work he paid for the supplies and the labor that he often hired to help him on big jobs he expec to be paid i can't imagine what would have happened to my father and his business if he had got a contract from  and showing up and subing his  had been told we're not going to pay and if you don't like it sue us my father never could have sued a big organization like that i just don't understand it i've met all kinds of workers painters plumbers i've met small businesses that provided pianos installed glass or marble all of whom were denied payment and after going back e and again being told well maybe we'll pay you  cents on the dollar or  cents on the dollar that's not how we do business in ama so we've got to create more good jobs that are going to help more people for example our modern service economy is empowering consumers with more choices than greater flexibility but we do have to empower the workers in our service sector too the people ta care of our children and our parents they deserve a good wage and good efits and a secure retirement  and it's crucial that every aman have access to the education and skills they need to get the jobs of the future so we will fight to make college tuition free for the middle class and debt free for everyone
 we will also liberate millions of people who already have student debt by ma it easier to refinance and repay what you owe as a portion of your income so don't have to pay more than you can afford  it  it is just not right that   can ignore his debts but students and families can't refinance their debt  and here's something else that i really want to emphasize i don't think anybody in ama is tal about this enough and that is a fouryear degree should not be the only path to a good job in ama  you should be able to learn a skill practice a trade make a good living doing it so many amans have the talent and the will to succeed whether they're kids right out of high school or older people displaced by automation and outsourcing and for too long big promises about the power of training and retraining haven't delivered like they should it doesn't help anybody to be trained for a job that doesn't exist so here's what we're gonna do we will support highquality union training programs we will propose  we will propose new tax credits to encourage more companies to offer paid apprenticeships that lets you earn while you learn  we will do more including a national campaign to dignify skills training across the board  i  i think we gotta reverse what has become a kind of you know common placed view which is everybody needs to go to college well in fact more than half of the jobs that are going to be available in  do not require a college fouryear degree so for welders and machinists and tool and dye  makers and health technicians and coders and so many others let's get the word out there are really good jobs for people right now and there will be more in the future if you get the skills in high school at community college in an apprenticeship or other training programs  and i  i wanna acknowledge the great role that the community college here in macomb county has played in wor with companies like this one to make sure people do have the skills now i imagine some of you might be thin well that all sounds good but what about trade after all  talks about it all the e well lets start with this it is true that too often past trade deals have been sold to the aman people with rosy scenarios that did not pan out those promises now bring hollow in many communities across michigan and our country that have seen factories close and jobs disappear too many companies lobbied for trade deals so they could sell products abroad but then they instead moved abroad and sold back into the uni states it is also true that china and other countries have gamed the system for too long enforcement particularly during the  administration has been too lax investments at home that would make us more competitive have been completely blocked in congress and aman workers in communities have paid the price but the answer is not to rant and rave or cut ourselves off from the world that would end up killing even more jobs the answer is to finally make trade work for us not against us so my message  my message to every worker in michigan and across ama is this i will stop any trade deal that kills jobs or holds down wages including the transpacific partnership  i oppose it now i'll oppose it after the election and i'll oppose it as president as a senator from new york i fought to defend new york's manufacturers and steel makers from unfair chinese trading practices
 and i opposed the only multilateral trade deal that came before the senate while i was there because it didn't meet my high bar and as secretary of state i fought hard for aman businesses to get a fair shot around the world and to stop underhanded trading practices like currency manipulation and the theft of intellectual property so as president i will stand up to china and anyone else who tries to take advantage of aman workers and companies  and i am going to ramp up enforcement by appointing for the first e a cheap trade prosecutor i will triple the number of enforcement officers and when countries break the rules  we won't hesitate to impose targe tariffs  now mr  may talk of big game on trade but his approach when it comes to trade is based on fear not strength fear that we cannot compete with the rest of the world even when rules are fair fear that our country has no choice but to hide behind walls if team usa was as fearful as   phelps and simone biles would be cowering in the locker room afraid to come out and compete instead they are winning gold medals ama isn't afraid to compete right now thousands of michigan companies are exporting ions of dollars of products around the world we want them to sell even more and create even more jobs here at home but corporations should not abandon profitable operations in the uni states to move abroad just to give shareholders a quicker return ceos a bigger bonus and unions a weaker hand to play now before he tweets about how he is really the one who will put ama first and trade let's remember where  makes many of his own products because it sure is not ama  he has made  ties in china and  suits in mexico instead of here in michigan he keeps saying it's not possible to make these things in ama anymore that's just wrong so we crea a website com/makeithere on it we list  places across the uni states that are already producing similar goods one positive thing  could do to make ama great again is to actually make great things in ama again now let's look at the second question which candidate will fight for fairness and this is an urgent need we need to grow the economy and make it fairer the tide is not rising fast enough and certainly not lifting all boats since the crash too many of the gains have gone to the top one percent the rules and incentives in our system reward corporations for putting shortterm stock prices above long e investment in their worker's equipment and research while corporate profits are at near record high paychecks for most people have barely budged incomes aren't growing fast enough to keep up with the cost of living for things like prescription drugs and childcare i believe every employee from the ceo suite to the factory floor contributes to a business' success so everyone should share in the rewards especially those putting in long hours for little pay so i'm proposing a new tax credit to encourage more companies to share profits with more 
 and more broadly we will fight for a more progressive or patriotic tax code that puts aman jobs first right now when a corporation outsources jobs and production it could write off the cost we must stop that and we must make them pay back any tax break they ever received them from any level of government in our country  and for those that move their headquarters overseas to avoid paying their fair share of taxes they're going to have to pay a new exit tax so if they want to go they're going to have to pay to go  and wall street corporations and the super rich should finally pay their fair share of taxes that's why i support the socalled buffet rule because multimillionaires should not be able to pay a lower tax rate than their secretaries  we should also add a new tax on multimillionaires crack down on tax gaming by corporations and close the carried interest loop holes something i've advoca for years now compare what  says now there is a myth out there that he will stick it to the rich and powerful because somehow he's really on the side of the little guy don't believe it not when he pledges to rip up basic rules that hold corporations accountable when he wants to scrap regulations that stop polluters from poisoning the air our children breathe and the water we drink let insurance companies write their own rules again  would roll back the tough rules that we have imposed on the financial industry i'll do the opposite i think we should strengthen those rules so wall street can never wreck main street again   even wants to abolish the consumer financial protection bureau a new agency that has already returned more than $ ion to  million amans who were taken advantage of by corporations why would you get rid of that and then there is 's tax plan he would give trillions in tax cuts to big corporations millionaires and wall street money managers that would explode our national debt and eventually lead to massive cuts in priorities like education healthcare and environmental protection in his speech on monday he called for a new tax loop hole let's talk it the  loop hole because it would allow him to pay less than half the current tax rate on income from many of his companies he'd pay a lower rate than millions of middle class families one non partisan expert at the tax policy center described this plan as and i quote a really nice deal for   of course it's hard to say how nice because he refuses to do what every other presidential candidate in decades has done and release his tax returns  but we do know that the  richest tax payers in ama would get an average tax cut of more than $ million a year from the  loop hole and then there's the estate tax which  wants to eliminate all together now if you believe that he's as wealthy as he says that alone would save the  family $ ion it would do nothing for  percent of amans so they'd get a $ ion tax cut and  percent of amans would get nothing just think of what we could do with those $ ion we could pay for more than  veterans to get a four year college degree we could provide a years worth of healthcare to nearly three million kids or we could fund a years worth of federal assistance to state and local law enforcement
 i think there are a lot of better ways to spend the money on monday i'm going to be in scranton pennsylvania with vice president  and he has a saying don't tell me what you value show me your budget and i will tell you what you value well     wants to give trillions in tax breaks to people like himself i want to invest it in veterans our kids our police officers and so much more and you can then draw your own conclusion about values now it's true that both of us have proposed to cut taxes for middle class families he's ma a big promise but his advisers have said  his own advisers have said he may not stand by them instead the tax cuts he doubledowns on in his speech in detroit on monday offered trillions to the richest amans and corporations and one of the differences between   and me is i'm telling you what i will do i'm laying out my plans and i will stand by them and want you to hold me accountable for delivering results  you know this all reminds me of that old saying if it sounds too good to be true it probably is and that brings us to the third question which candidate can you actually count on to go to bat for workers and wor families it is not enough to pay lip service to being on your side we have to recognize how amans actually live and work in the st century and then offer real solutions that make your lives easier we know that women are now the sole or primary breadwinner in a growing number of families we know more amans are cobbling together parte work or stri out on their own so we have to make it easier to be good workers good parents and good caregivers all at the e e that's why i've set out a bold vision to make quality affordable childcare available to all amans and limit the cost to  percent of family income  on monday  offered his first real ideas on this topic because previously he had dismissed concerns about childcare he said it was quote not an expensive thing because you just need some blocks and some swings now he says he wants to exclude childcare payments from taxation his plan was panned from the left the right the center because it transparently is designed for rich people like him he would give wealthy families  or  cents on the dollar for their nannies and little or nothing for millions of hardwor families trying to afford childcare so that they can get to work and keep the job  i think instead we should expand the child tax credit to provide real relief to tens of millions of wor families struggling with the cost of raising children  the e families that his plan ignores and that's just a start because the more we do to help wor families the more our entire economy will efit for example guaranteeing equal pay won't just increase paychecks for women it will boost family budgets and get incomes rising across the board  and i don't understand why  is against that paid family leave will not only make life easier for moms and dads it will also keep skilled talen amans in the workforce and grow our economy that's why every other advanced country already has it again he's against it raising the federal minimum wage won't just put more money in the pockets of lowincome families it also means they will spend more at the businesses in their neighborhoods  this is  this is something that even the original automakers understood way back at the beginning of the th century when they decided to pay the unbelievable sum of $ a day to autoworkers and when they were criticized by other businesses  how can you pay that much they had the best answer we want people to be able to buy our cars this is economics  we need to get incomes and wages rising and it will help the whole economy grow and be fairer  and protecting and expanding social security doesn't just help older amans retire with dignity it helps to ease burdens on families and communities and i also believe the e thing about comprehensive immigration reform we already have millions of people wor in the economy and paying $ ion a year to social security even though they are undocumen so by moving toward reform we will unleash a lot of new income and growth and we will level the playing field so that aman workers cannot be taken advantage of because undocumen workers can be exploi by employers which is one of the reasons we have this disconnect and finally strengthening unions does not just serve members it leads to better pay and efits and wor conditions for all employees  so i have also said i will defend and improve the affordable care act for me that includes giving amans in every state the choice of a public option health insurance plan that will help everyone afford coverage it will strengthen competition and drive down costs now these are all causes i have worked on for decades and i believe they point to a fundamental truth about the economy it can seem like zero sum  when you are competing for a job promotion or contract if someone wins and someone loses but that is not the full picture if you step back you can see we are all in this together if we grow together we can all rise together and you know what i like to say we are all stronger together the fourth question is key and it's this who can bring people together to get any of this done right well  i believe i can because i think i can provide serious steady leadership that can provide common ground to build on it based upon hard but respectful bargaining with the other side leadership that rises above personal attacks and namecalling not revels in it i just do not think insults and bullying is how we are to get things done i do not think that that is the appropriate approach for us i know it's hard to imagine but there was a e when s and s actually worked together i know that's true i did it as first lady senator and secretary of state it is how we crea the children's health insurance program which covers eight million kids it is how we rebuilt new york after / and how we passed a treaty to reduce the threat from russia's nuclear weapons so i am convinced based on my experience that we can do this one of the reasons that i asked senator   to be my running mate is that he also has a record of wor across the aisle to get things done as a mayor governor and a senator so we are going to make full use of the white house's power to convene we are going to get everyone at the table not just s and s but businesses and labor unions academics but most importantly amans like all you i think there are a lot of great ideas out in ama and i want you to have a say and that means we've got to get unaccountable money out of politics overturn citizens uni and expand voting rights not restrict them i intend starting even before the election to bring together leaders from across the economy from a lot of different places to talk about jobs and competitiveness i  mark and  can join me because we need the best ideas that are out there ma a difference  we need to pull together the bottomline is this i am running for president to build an economy that works for everyone not just those at the top  and based on what we know from the  campaign he wants amans to work for him and his friends at the expense of everyone else he has offered no credible plans to address what wor families are up against today nothing on student loans or the cost of description drugs nothing for farmers or struggling rural communities
 nothing to build a new future with clean energy and advance agriculture nothing for communities of color in our cities to overcome the barriers of systemic racism nothing to create new opportunities for young all it is just a more extreme version of the failed theory of tle down economics with his own addition of outlandish ian ideas that even s reject and as we heard him say at his convention he may believe that he alone can fix our country but clearly he doesn't know the people of michigan he doesn't see the businesses and the labor unions the local governments the clergy coming together every single day to make things better so yeah there is still a long road ahead but michigan is on the rise and everyone is contributing that's ama at its best so i  you will stay active and engaged and wor together to create jobs and to strengthen your own communities and i  you will work to get out the vote in november because if we  if we are able to win then i want you all to work with me to build the kind of progress that ama deserves to see we're going do this together we are stronger together let's go out and build the future thank you all god bless you    presidential candidate delivers remarks at a campaign event grand rapids michigan

 hello grand valley 
   
 thank you thank you
   
 it is great to be back in western michigan thank you  are there any lakers here  oh my gosh i am so thrilled to be here i want to thank the president of this great university tom haas the faculty the staff the students i want to thank brandon dillon the chair of the michigan  party    and i especially really want to thank you for sending debbie staow to the uni states senate  i have also the great personal experience and privilege of having worked with debbie gotten to know her become a friend of hers and i am so exci at the possibility that i'll be able to work with her again but i want you to know this  and i really really  you'll tell folks because there is no more dedica effective member of the uni states senate than debbie staow  she fights for all of you every day but she does it with that smile that never leaves her face and she brings people together who are on opposite sides of issues because she just keeps tal and don't we need more of that in washington where people actually talk and listen to each other so it's wonderful to be with all of you and to be introduced by debbie are you ready to vote tomorrow michigan  are you ready to help get your friends to vote tomorrow that is clearly the right answer because we have a really important election tomorrow  the choice in this election could not be clearer and i know that for many people you've gone back and forth you've thought about what to do and i really respect that but let me say this let me say this this election is basically between division and unity in our country  it's between strong and steady leadership or a loose cannon who could put everything at risk it is between an economy that works for everyone or one that is even more stacked for those at the top and i want each and every one of you to be thin through about all the issues that you care about because although my name and my opponents name will be on the ballot those issues and those values are on the ballot as well and as you think about what you care about and what you want your future to look like you have to recognize this is a consequential election i have been privileged to know a lot of our presidents over the past decades and people who ran for president i was privileged to know as a college student gerald ford  in fact i had an internship with the house  conference comee which he headed after my junior year in college so when i say i've gotten to know a lot of our presidents and people who've run for president it goes back a ways and here's what i want you to understand i didn't agree with everything they did or said even the s we had differences and politics and policies and somees on principle but i never doub i never doub that they were fit to serve as our president and commanderinchief  that's why this election is so different and it's why so many s have spoken out to endorse me and support me and who have taken very courageous stands against the nominee of their own party  because they believe that we must put country ahead of party when it comes to this election  i was at kent state in ohio last week and i was introduced by a gentleman by the name of bruce blair and mr blair had served in the air force he was a young officer assigned to be what was called a launch officer that meant he served his e every day sitting in a bunker where the controls for launching nuclear weapons were housed and his job  imagine the responsibility a young air force officer in his twenties waiting to hear whether or not an order is given for him to launch nuclear weapons and bruce blair explained that there is no appeal from a president's order to do that the joint chiefs of our military forces can't say no don't do it there's no veto from congress or anyone else and the e between the order being given and the actual launch is four minutes so after watching this election mr blair began contacting others who had served in this incredibly responsible position to share his concerns about what he was hearing and seeing and several dozen of them  i'd never met them before  several dozen of them wrote a letter explaining why they could never support   to be our commanderinchief  the awesome responsibility that is housed in one person is something i want you to think about between now and the e you vote because i will pledge to you that i will exercise the greatest care and responsibility in all of the powers inves in the office of the presidency 
   
 i also want to pose to you a contrast in visions did any of you see the debates first of all i did stand for four and a half hours with   on the stage proving conclusively i have the stamina to be president  but i have to say in addition to that there were so many things that he said that of course i somees was surprised by but the theme that ran through much of his rhetoric was the presentation of a dark and divisive vision for ama now i have to tell you i know we've got problems i've spent  months traveling around our country tal to  by now  hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people hearing what's on people's minds we've got challenges but ama's always had challenges and since when do we become pessimistic and not able to think about what we can do to overcome those challenges and solve those problems together  i often didn't recognize the country that   was describing because from my perspective loo back at our history we have a tremendous opportunity ahead of us and you can vote for a ful inclusive bighear ama that will set the stage for an even better future  and i want to say especially to the students who are here  i really believe that ama's best days are still ahead of us if we reach for them together  make no mistake our core values are being tes in this election but my faith in our future has never been stronger last night in manchester new hampshire i was introduced by mr khizr khan  some of you know or remember that his son captain khan serving in the uni states army was killed serving in iraq and like at the  convention this summer he spoke powerfully about what ama means to him and how we have to defend our values and our constitution that are the envy of the rest of the world people look at us with yearning they see that we are a beacon of freedom  and opportunity for people right here at home  when i heard mr khan speak at the convention and i heard him again last night i was so touched because what he said exhibi a love of our country he said that when he star hearing   speak and all of the things he said about so many people not only muslims but africanamans and latinos and pows and women and so many people  when he heard it he couldn't help but think as he walked around his house  he has a room where his son's medals  he got the bronze star he got the purple heart  the flag that was draped on his coffin  is respectfully presen in the box that he was given it in and he thought to himself would there be any room for my son in  's ama think about that for a minute because every single one of us has something to contribute to this great country we are already great but we can be greater and we will be greater   i love our country and i believe in the aman people and i know there is nothing we can't do when we make up our minds throughout our history generations of amans have risen together to meet the tests of their e they defended democracy they built the greatest middle class the world has ever known they marched for civil rights and voting rights for workers' rights and union rights for lgbt rights rights for people with disabilities    and now we've got to come together and we have to prove we can meet the challenges of our e we've got to get the economy wor for everybody not just those at the top  if you believe as i do that ama thrives when the middle class thrives then you have to vote tomorrow  we are going to make the biggest investment in good paying jobs since world war ii jobs in infrastructure our roads our bridges our tunnels our ports our airports our water systems  these are jobs we need doing in aman and these are jobs that cannot be expor they've got to be done right here in michigan and across our country  and we are going to invest in new jobs in advanced manufacturing i am not one of these folks who think we just can't make it in ama anymore and i'll tell you why because if we have a plan and we actually commit to fulfilling that plan we can lead the world in precision machining in d printing we're not competing for lowwage jobs we're competing with germany for high manufacturing high skilled jobs  and we are going to have clean renewable energy jobs as a way to fight climate change as you heard my opponent chose to make many of his products overseas and as i poin out in the last debate he buys cheap chinese steel and aluminum instead of good aman steel made by aman steel workers  he's gone all over this country and he's gone all over michigan tal about how he's gonna really get more jobs and he's going to bring back what used to be there well i'll tell you what look at his record don't just listen to his rhetoric  because i have a different idea we're going to invest in ama again and for everybody who is frustra and anxious and maybe even angry because they feel left out left behind that ama's not wor the way it should  i understand that i understand that i represen upstate new york for eight years and i saw first hand a lot of the loss of jobs and factories pic up and moving out but i also realized that anger is not a plan you've got to come together and figure out what is it we're gonna do to bring new jobs back and create more opportunity for people  and i'll just tell you that i believe that we've got to defend the aman worker's right to organize and bargain for better wages and efits  we're gonna get incomes rising here in western michigan and across this state and we're also gonna do more to help small business my dad was a small businessman he worked really hard he ran a printing plant that prin fabrics for draperies and i would from e to e help him out you take a silkscreen you put it down on the long table you pour the paint in you do the squeegee you pick it up  it wasn't automa we were the automaters  and you'd go all the way down to one table you'd go to the other table so i know how hard people in small business work and i also know something else   made a lot of money off the backs of small business people and contractors by stiffing them and refusing to pay his s and i have said i am sure glad my dad never got a contract from   because we could not have afforded that  but it's not just enough to grow the economy we have to make it fairer and if you believe we need a fairer economy then you have to vote i think the best antidote for whatever ails a person is a good job i believe in hard work that's how i was raised but i also believe that if you work hard and you work full e you shouldn't still be in poverty at the end of the year and i'm gonna raise the national minimum wage and one of the things i've heard all over ama especially from young families really from all families but particularly young families is how hard it is to do so many of the things that are expec  like where do you find affordable quality childcare in lots of states it's more expensive than college tuition we're gonna get the cost of childcare down we're going to have a paid family leave program so that when you have a sick relative or you're sick you won't lose your job  i saw the folks over there holding up the   sign and i really appreciate that thank you thank you i got to tell you   and i were in pittsburgh last month with a big crowd and we couldn't get everybody in like today so  went out to say hello to people and he saw a woman holding a baby probably about three years old and he stopped to talk to her and she said i came here because i wan to tell you and to tell   what happened to me she said that i had my baby it was a hard labor and delivery and i needed some e off and i called by boss and said the doctors want me to take some e off and so i won't be in for  i think she said two weeks  and they said ok you're fired that is legal in ama still and what that does is to say that  wait a minute do we really value children do we really value families and we've got to have a system that is fair to employers and fair to employees because you got to be able to balance work and family in today's ama  and then finally i think it is way past e to guarantee equal pay for women's work  and you know i gotta say  this always gets a huge round of applause as you can tell  but this is not just a woman's issue it's a family issue if you have a wife a mother a sister a daughter who's in the work force you want her to be paid what she deserves to be paid to help you and your family  just about everything i've said so far my opponent disagrees with and whenever i talk about affordable childcare and paid family leave and equal pay  he says i'm playing the woman's card and you know what i say if that's the case then deal me in  and here's what else i want you to know it's fair to ask how are you going to pay for that that's not only fair that's necessary to ask because i want to be a good steward of your tax dollars just as i expect you're a good steward of your family budget i have proposed a very simple formula i will not raise taxes on anyone ma less than $ a year  and for small businesses we're gonna cut your taxes because i know a lot of small businesses need that kind of tax relief so instead we're going where the money is to the millionaires and the ionaires and the big corporations  and that is in stark contrast to what   has proposed his whole economic plan is cut trillions of dollars in taxes from millionaires and ionaires and corporations that is tledown economics on steroids i profoundly disagree i think the way you build an economy is from the middle out and the bottom up not from the top down  when you think about it  hasn't paid anything for  years he's paid zero to support our military our vets pell grants for students here at grand valley our highways  and i am still pondering i am just pondering how anybody can lose a ion dollars in one year especially when you're running casinos i do not understand that but that will be one of the mysteries in this campaign because he's not going to release his tax returns now and the e you start voting and that sort of suggests there must be something really terrible in those tax returns because everybody else for more than  years has released them so we'll still wonder but what we know is his economic approach will cost us jobs not create jobs and we can't afford that we need to keep building we have recovered from the worst financial crash since the great depression but we're not where we need to be yet the last thing we need is a failed economic policy coming back in and pushing us back down and depriving people of the jobs that we want to create  and if you believe all of our kids should have good schools and good teachers no matter what zip code they live in then you have to vote  and if you believe college should be affordable you have to vote i've got to say i am proud of the campaign that   and i ran it was a campaign about ideas and issues not insults and when it was over we actually got together what a novel idea we wan to figure out how we can work together to actually produce on some of the goals that we both shared so  and i worked on this plan together public colleges and universities should be tuitionfree for everyone who makes less than a $ a year and they should be debtfree for everyone else because nobody should go into debt and if you have gone into debt if you're among the millions of amans who are struggling  as i see some hands pointing in the air  paying back your student debt we are going to help you pay it down and pay it off  it makes no sense at all we have interest rates that are really low right now buy a car for what  or  percent you can buy a house for  percent there are so many people who are paying    higher     percent interest  how much twelve point seven fourteen point one i got to tell you friends that is outrageous the federal government should not be ma money off of sending kids to college  i can't wait to roll up my sleeves with debbie and  and we're gonna get to work right after this election if i am fortunate enough to win  look wor for children and families has been the cause of my life but it's never been more important than it is right now and that has to be our mission together doing all we can to help every aman and especially every young aman and every child in ama to have the chance to live up to their godgiven potential i will wake up every single day in the white house trying to figure out what i can do to make that a reality for you  so after tomorrow the work will begin and one of the highest priorities that i feel an obligation to address is how we bring our country together a lot of people say we've got to heal our country or as the bible says repair the breach because we have so much divisiveness right now we've got to start listening to each other respecting each other i know it is unusual i admit for somebody running for president especially the day before an election but i've been saying this for months to say that we need more of two things right now we need more love and kindness in ama  i don't know about you i don't know about you but i bet everyone of us has received a kindness and maybe i  we've all extended one i am standing here today because my mother who was abandoned by her parents rejec by her grandparents went to work at the age of  as a maid and a babysitter was extended kindness not by those who should have loved her but by others the first grade teacher who saw she had nothing to eat at lunch who began bringing extra food the woman whose house she went to work in who knew that my mother wan to go to high school she would have been a freshman in high school when she had to leave her grandparents' home and she got this job and that woman said i know you want to go to high school if you get up early and you get your chores done you can go to high school but you'll have to come back because we'll need you in the late afternoon now that may sound harsh to say to a year old but to my mother it was a gift i tell you this because we all have to start thin about how we want to be trea and what that means about how we treat others and   there's a version of the golden rule in every major religion and it is a reminder that every one of us gets knocked down the question as my mother would say is are you gonna get back up and for people in our country who feel like they've been knocked down and nobody cares nobody's paying attention here's what i want you to know if you give me the honor of being your president i'm gonna do everything i can to get this country and everybody in it back up on our feet moving forward together  because i want to be a president for all amans  s s independents not just the people who support me everybody in this country because i believe with all my

 wow i'll tell you
    
 i think this is one of the best places for a crowd event ever  folks  folks here get all fired up and energized and  i have to ask you did  did any of you see the debates
 yes
 well i spent four and halfhours standing next to   proving conclusively i have stamina to be the next president  but you know he said so many  so many things in those debates laughter  you know when you debate in front of you know    million plus people you gotta  you gotta have a sense of preparation readiness calmness composure and i'll tell you some of what i heard coming from my opponent it was really hard not to go what did you say  you know he kept  he kept saying things like well what have you done for  years and well we know what he's done for  years and i mean back in the 's he star with discriminating against africanamans and latinos by refusing to rent them apartments in new york  he has a long history of insulting people it did not just start in the campaign you can go back and  and find what he said about all kinds of folks and one of the things i discovered in preparing for the debates which i was kind of surprised by is that he took out a full page in  to criticize president reagan so he is an equal opportunity insulter laughter you know but i did choose a different path from him i've spent my career fighting for kids and families and i'm proud that i have  i helped to start something called the children's health insurance program as first lady  it covers eight million kids and i have to tell you that traveling around pennsylvania  really anywhere in the country  i meet people who have been affec by the kinds of changes that we can do that give more folks a chance to get ahead i'm all about ma sure the aman dream is big enough for everybody  and we're going to knock down the barriers that stand in the way and you know if you don't have your health it's pretty hard to get ahead right and so i meet families who tell me about what that meant and it makes me very grateful and i was a senator from new york on /   and i spent my eight years in the senate helping to rebuild new york keep us safer at home and to provide health care to our brave first responders our firefighters our police our emts who ran toward danger  and as your secretary of state i traveled to  countries negotia ceasefires reduced the threat of nuclear weapons   stood up for n rights and women's rights and workers' rights and lgbt rights around the world  now i  i really believe that if you want to get things done that'll help people you start by listening to people bringing them together and i know that is not very exciting i admit and i do feel kind of sorry for the press covering me because what are they going to say for the th e she was listening to people laughter i get that but everything i've done star there and then you bring people together you put them around the table they don't all agree with each other and then you work to find common ground that's what i did in the senate and as secretary of state i could've never gotten anything done if i hadn't worked with s   and others who had different points of view and i want you to know if you elect me on tuesday that is the kind of president i will be listening   learning finding common ground  and from the very first day of this campaign i've been putting forward my ideas about how to help you and your families get ahead and i truly believe you deserve a candidate you can vote for not just someone to vote against  and so you can go to my website   and i wrote a book called stronger together because i want you to know what the agenda is and i want you to hold me accountable when i come back to pittsburgh which i  to do on a regular basis
  i want people to say hey you know i saw where you wan to do more on infrastructure how's that going how many new jobs do we have what kinds of opportunities do we have with clean renewable energy jobs what about raising the national minimum wage  now one way or another ama is going to have a new president on january th right and people say all the e that they want change well we will get change change is inevitable that is certain the question is what kind of change are we going to have  and  and here's where i think the choice could not be clearer are we going to build a stronger fairer better ama or are we going to fear each other and the future hunker down against each other i don't think that will lead to anything positive and what i  we will do in this election and in these remaining four days is to think about the kind of country we want imagine what we can do together every e i come into pittsburgh now because i star driving through pittsburgh decades ago because my dad was from scranton and we drove through pennsylvania every year  we took different routes and we went to different places and i  with my own eyes  have seen the ups and the downs of this great city and now when i drive in what do i see i see a positive opistic confident city ma progressive moving forward  and i don't think you do anything in life unless you kind of imagine what it will look like and then you get to work to do it that's how mark has built these great companies right here in pittsburgh when he was a young guy and wor hard for everything he had he got a chance to start imagining and then he got a chance to start acting and producing results well that's the way it works that's the way it works with the steelers right i mean people imagine what the team can be like they plan the coaches they work hard the players like mel and franco they practice they plan you don't just say hey just get out on the field do whatever you want laughter that's not the way it works my friends and so what i'm hoping is that we will imagine two different amas just for the sake of this exercise imagine it's   standing in front of the capitol  and we already know a lot about him someone who demeans women mocks people with disabilities insults african amans and latinos and demonizes immigrants and muslims and pits people against each other instead of pulling us together and think about what it would mean to entrust the nuclear codes to someone   with a very thin skin who lashes out at anyone who challenges him imagine how easily it could be that   would feel insul and start a real war  not just a twitter war  at  in the morning imagine what it would mean for our economy to have someone who built his career exploiting workers stiffing small businesses now you heard earlier from  tesoro he designed a building for    told him he loved it it was at one of his golf courses and then  would not pay the  now  didn't have the resources to sue the  organization so  just walked away from what was owed this is someone who personally signed  not some executive  he personally signed a contract with a unionbusting firm to keep workers at one of his hotels from being able to organize and bargain collectively
 and just yesterday   was told he was brea the law by not negotiating with his hotel workers in las vegas and we know  and the steelworkers sure know  he chose to build two of his buildings with chinese steel and aluminum instead of supporting ama's steel industry and aman steelworkers  everywhere he goes he leaves people behind you know one of my goals as president is to encourage more companies to do what mark did with profitsharing if any of you were with us when mark endorsed me   and i were here in pittsburgh and he talked about how he had shared the profits of his company including the profits he gained when he sold his companies i think you told me mark you made  millionaires at your first company  look we've got to have a strong private sector we need business to be creating more jobs i really like the kind of jobs and business that mark does because what he is to worry about and take care the people who helped made him successful in the first place  now imagine having a president who owes hundreds of millions of dollars to foreign banks and other foreign entities that he doesn't tell us about ask yourself so if he's sitting across the table negotiating with people from those countries is he going to put his own financial interests ahead of ama's interests i can tell you this when i'm sitting across the table from the russians or anyone else i know who i'm representing the aman people and our interests  now my friends we got some good news this morning our economy crea  jobs last month
 that is  that is  straight months of job growth  and i believe that our economy is poised to really take off and thrive but we need to make sure the economy is wor for everyone not just those at the top and that is my pledge i believe in growth from the middle out and the bottom up when the middle class thrives ama thrives    believes something different he wants an economy that works for him that's why he wants to give the biggest tax breaks in history to the super wealthy and big corporations his own family would get a $ ion tax break now   figure that out we know he hasn't paid taxes right if it turns out that he's as rich as he claims it would be tle down economics on steroids the wealthy would be paying lower tax rates than ever his plan  and this is what i want you to hear  so he's ta care of himself he's ta care of his family he's ta care of the super wealthy and corporations his plan would actually raise taxes on  million lowincome and middle class people  he would hit especially hard   percent of single parents would see their taxes go up  that means that  wor families in pennsylvania would pay more under 's plan honestly i don't know how he lives with himself doesn't he see  doesn't he see what we see the millions of moms and dads struggling to make ends meet balance the demands of work and family or does he just not care remember this is a man who said pregnancy is an inconvenience for an employer  he has said and i quote putting a wife to work is a very dangerous thing  well i see things differently when i say we need to make the economy work for everyone not just those at the top i mean everyone families are facing a lot of pressures in many families women are contributing to the income of their families or they are the sole  the sole income in the family  more people than ever are wor gigs on the side just to make extra money or to make ends meet and for wor families the cost of everything is going up from childcare to prescription drugs to college education and i think we all know somebody who's wor two minimum wage jobs and trying to raise their families at the e e it's hard being good workers and good parents and we know young people who want to start a small business the way mark did it when he got going and maybe they want to buy a first home or they just got married and they're trying to get ahead in life but student debt is holding them back and i want us to know that i will do everything i can to help ease the costs of middle class and wor and poor families so that more people   can do better
 and right now so many of the people  so many of the people who are doing the toughest most important jobs in our country are getting paid the least and a lot of them are women and people of color right childcare workers trying to take care of our kids   nurses who work the night shift and spend more e with their patients than the doctors do the home health aides who keep our seniors independent and healthy  there are so many jobs of value to our society where the paychecks don't reflect how important they are so i will do everything i can to get incomes rising for hardwor people whether you work in steel whether you work in a factory whether you're a machinist a nurse a teacher a firefighter a police office whatever you are you deserve to be part of a growing thriving middleclass economy  and so that's why  that's why we're going to raise the national minimum wage   and we're going to join every other advanced economy and make sure we've got paid family and medical leave so you can take care of the people you love  and here it is  don't you think it's finally e to guarantee equal pay for women  well i got to tell you this is not a woman's issue it's a family issue if you have a mother a wife a daughter a sister you want her to be paid equally because that goes to your family's bottom line now i've gotten sort of used to the fact that when i talk about equal pay or paid family leave or affordable child care   and his supporters say i'm playing the woman card well i'll tell you what if fighting for those kids and family issues is playing the women's card you know what i say deal me in  we are going to invest in our people especially our young people we don't have anybody to waste or leave behind we can't leave any talent on the sidelines and we've got to make sure we fight against discrimination  we've got to work in communities where factories have closed and nothing has come in to replace it like so many places in central and western pa and we're going to make the biggest investment in good paying jobs since world war ii there's a lot of good work to be done in this country and that work will put people in jobs here in ama that cannot be expor they've got to be done right here  so my friends we're going to make our economy stronger for decades we're going to make ama the st century clean energy superpower   we're going to produce enough renewable energy to power every home we're going to make it easier for small businesses and entrepreneurs to get the credit they need to grow and we're going to make it possible again to say and believe it that in ama if you can dream it you can build it  and part of that dream is ma sure people get the education and the skills they need so here's what i want to do starting in preschool i want to better prepare every kid to do well in real school right  i want every kid to have good schools and good teachers in every zip code in ama not just some
 i want us to bring back technical education to high school and once again   lift up those good paying necessary jobs that don't require a fouryear college degree  i want us to do more with our community colleges and more apprenticeship programs by unions and businesses to help prepare people  and i am tired of meeting young people that can't either start or finish college because they can't afford it  we're going to make public colleges and universities tuitionfree if you make less than $ a year  and for people who are audio gap
 you know i make lists all the e laughter i make lists of my lists laughter but i have a list about what we're going to do and it's because it all comes down to this i love our country and i believe in the aman people and i know there's nothing we can't achieve if we work together  so as you head to the polls as you talk to your friends and neighbors who might still be deciding who to vote for please ask them to search their heart about what kind of country we want for our kids and our grandkids  it is not as important that they think about voting for me as it is they think about voting for themselves  every issue we care about is on the ballot on tuesday and i know that if we have a big win on tuesday we will have a big wind behind our backs going into the government in january  so tell everybody please to vote and that you can make the difference going to the polls on tuesday november th if you don't know where to vote go to iwillvotecom to confirm your voting location or to find out how to send in an absentee ballot we are on track right now to having the biggest turn out in aman history  people in states where they have early voting have already set a record we have  million people who've already vo  and if you know anybody here in pittsburgh or in western pa who's thin about voting for  please stage an intervention before it's too late  i mean really just sit down with them and ask them what they care about and if they say they're just frustra or angry say you understand but anger's not a plan  we've got work to do we're going to roll up our sleeves and we're going to do it together
 and if you can give us any e  if you can give us any e to volunteer go to com to sign up or text join join at  because believe me i don't want any of us  not me and not you  to wake up on wednesday and think if we'd only done a little bit more things would have turned out differently somees the fate of the greatest nations comes down to single moments in e this is one of those makeorbreak moments for the uni states it is in your hands  and when your kids and your grandkids ask what you did in  when everything was on the line i  you'll be able to say i vo for a better stronger fairer ama   where we build  walls we don't build walls we build bridges and where we build the future that we want and where we prove once and for all that love s hate  thank you all god bless you   presidential candidate delivers remarks at a campaign event oakland pennsylvania

 hello pittsburgh  whoa hello back there
   
 thank you thank you wow 
 it's great to be here at this extraordinary e in our country's history at this great university  to have a chance on a beautiful day to lift our sights to think about what we are capable of doing together the kind of future that we can create if we search for and find common ground and it is thrilling to have traveled across our country to see the fulness to talk about the positive changes that are occurring to really see ama at its best and tomorrow each and every one of you gets to make a decision as to whether or not first you will vote because in pennsylvania it is all about election day  other places around the country have been voting for weeks and what you will vote for i am here to ask you to vote for yourselves vote for your families vote for your futures vote on the issue that matter to you because they are on the ballot not just my name and my opponent's name  i want to thank tom colicchio for coming out here he is in the middle of opening up another one of his great restaurants but he said he has these two small kids and he just had to come and be apart of lifting up this election and creating the kind of commitment that will bring a recordbrea number amans to vote we are on the path to see more amans vote than we have ever seen in our history  i am hoping that you wont just come out and vote obviously i  you vote for me but i also   i  that you will send katie mcginty to the uni states senate  we've got some great elec officials here and i want to recognize congressmen  doyle  county executive rich fitzgerald from pittsburgh mayor  peitersen  from dock pa mayor  fetterman  but mostly i am here to say thanks thanks for ta e out to think about what's the stakes are  i love you all too absolutely 
   
 so for those who are still ma up your minds or thin maybe its not worth voting at all let me just say the choice in this election could not be clearer it really is between division or unity between strong and steady leadership or a loose cannon between an economy that works for everyone not just those at the top and an economy that is set up and run for those at top now i have spent my public career fighting for kids and families and standing up for our country and if you give me the privilege of your vote tomorrow that is what i will do every single day of my presidency  i will get up in the white house and i will think about what i can do that day to knock down barriers to create opportunities so that you have the chance to fulfill your own dreams you see i believe ama's best days are still ahead of us
 now that doesn't mean we do have to work for it because we do that doesn't mean we can just expect it to happen as kind of a birthright but i really believe that i would not have work for  months traveled across our country fought as hard as i have about what we need to do and how to do it together proudly stand up and defend the legacy of president  which has   given our country progress in the right direction if i did not believe with all my heart that we could do this right  we can do this  we don't have to accept a dark and divisive vision for ama tomorrow you can vote for a ful inclusive bighear ama  and our core values are being tes in this election and i know that people are frustra a lot of people feel left out and left behind there's fear even anger in our country but i've got to say anger is not a plan my friends if we're going to harness our energy and try to overcome our problems then we've got to start tal to each other again  and we have to get good ideas wherever they come from last night i was in manchester new hampshire and i was with khizr khan whose son captain khan was killed while serving in iraq you might remember him from the  convention he was not a man to be on the stage of a political convention but when he heard my opponent say what he said about muslims and he looked at the flag that had been draped on his son's coffin he felt compelled to speak out he spoke powerfully about what ama means to him and how we have to defend our values and our constitution as he said last night his son serving in the uni states army with his unit saw something suspicious moved toward it to check it out telling his men to stay behind and when the car exploded he lost his life inaudible the bronze star and the purple inaudible but as mr khan said when you listen to all of the people that my opponent has insul and denigra would there be a place in  's ama for captain khan the khan family gives me  because they truly believe in the values of inaudible of ours and they have stood up holding the constitution as he did at the inaudible to say people around the world cherish this constitution believe in our values inaudible for ions of people we will never ever let that go and we will inaudible someone rip it away in the kind of negative divisive hateful campaign that we have seen inaudible in this election  somees when i hear my opponent speak i don't recognize inaudible it doesn't mean we don't have problems and challenges it doesn't mean that inaudible to do more to help our country get better economic opportunities of course we do inaudible i believe we could inaudible i love our country inaudible the aman people i know what we are capable of  inaudible throughout our history generations of amans have risen together to meet the test of their e they defended democracy built the greatest middle class the world has inaudible marched for civil rights for workers' rights inaudible rights for people with disabilities
 inaudible we face the test inaudible will we be coming together as a nation inaudible further apart will we set goals that all of us inaudible meet will we turn on each other and pit one group of amans  against another now our names will be on the ballot tomorrow but those values and inaudible you care about will be  there too what kind of country do we want and i particularly think about this for young people as i look at inaudible so many inaudible amans who deserve the e opportunities and the inaudible many of us were given  we will make sure they are available because if you think about what it takes to have a thriving ama it comes down to a couple of key inaudible if you believe that ama thrives when the middle inaudible then you have to vote  we're gonna make the biggest investment in goodpaying jobs since world war ii jobs in infrastructure small business clean energy advanced manufacturing  we're gonna actually deliver on that unlike my opponent who makes his products mostly overseas inaudible chinese steel and aluminum inaudible made by aman steel workers right here in pennsylvania  inaudible in aman and we're especially going to invest in communities that are left out inaudible stand up for the inaudible across ama  inaudible economy as i do then the national inaudible because nobody who works inaudible be in poverty  and we're gonna do more to support wor families with affordable childcare inaudible  i've got to tell you this inaudible the biggest applause ever because inaudible know it's not fair but it's also inaudible wor you don't want inaudible do you
 no
 when i talk about equal pay and all these other family inaudible my opponent says i'm playing the woman's card well you know what i inaudible deal me in  you know if you believe all of our kids should have good schools and good teachers no matter what zip code they inaudible you have to vote  if inaudible that we can make college inaudible for every young inaudible  audio gap
 and after it was over he and i got together and we came up with this plan public colleges and universities should be tuition free for everyone who makes less than $ a year  and it should be debtfree for everyone else i don't think you should go into this massive debt to get your education it's good for you it's good for your families it's good for our country and we're going to make it affordable for everyone  and for the millions of amans already struggling with student debt we're going to ease that burden we're going to get those interest rates down we're going to give you a different way of repaying it as a percentage of your income not tied to a six eight ten percent interest rate  and you're never going to have to pay more than you can afford  you see i think there are a lot of positive things to get exci about and i think the agenda we've put forth in this campaign is one that will really give everybody  you see wor for children and families has been the cause of my life but it's never been more important than it is right now so this has to be our mission together doing all we can to help every aman especially every young aman and especially every child to have the chance to live up to your godgiven potential because when it's all said and done that's what matters most have you helped somebody else have you reached out and tried to ease somebody's burden we do it individually my mother got through a neglec abandoned childhood because people showed her kindness her own parents didn't want her her grandparents didn't want her but that first grade teacher who saw she had nothing to eat brought extra food every single day to make sure my mother had something to eat  and when she was  and had to go out and find a job to support herself and got a job as a maid and a babysitter in somebody's home she was just relieved that she had a place to live and that she could support herself but the mother of that home understood my mom wan to go to high school so she said dorothy if you get up early and you get your chores done you can go to high school you'll have to come right back because we'll need you but you can do it now look that sounds harsh to our ears telling a yearold ok you can go to high school but you've got to come right back and you have to work on both sides of it but to my mother it was a blessing
 so when i think about what so many people have gone through to give us the opportunities that we have had  and i'm spea for myself my mother gave me the resilience the grit the get up and go she told me everybody gets knocked down what matters is whether you get back up  and we had a lot of amans knocked down because of the great recession didn't we millions of jobs were lost millions of homes were lost family wealth was wiped out savings accounts ks everything that people had worked so hard for well we've dug ourselves out of the hole now we've got to get up and we've got to make sure we don't leave anybody behind i see this man standing here with a sign coal miners for  and i'll tell you sir  i know how hard es are and as i have said and you can take it to the bank i will not forget you and i will do everything i can to help people who have given so much worked so hard throughout their lives for generations to build this country we are not gonna forget any aman  but i can't do any of this without your help tomorrow this election is going to really set the course of our country there's no doubt in my mind tonight i'll be in philadelphia with president  and   and i so appreciate how hard they have worked for me but it's not for me it's for us you know when president  came into office put yourself in his shoes this young dynamic first african aman elec to become president of the uni states  and what does he find he finds the worst financial crisis since the great depression that's what he finds wow those were hard hard es i don't think he gets the credit he deserves for ma sure we didn't go even deeper into the ditch we were in  but make no mistake there were reasons we ended up in that ditch it didn't happen by accident we had huge tax cuts on the wealthy the administration in office took their eyes off the financial markets and we know what happened they ignored the pressures in the mortgage markets and we know what happened elections have consequences for everything we care about and that's why we've got to have each and every one of you put down your stake in our future if the lines are long tomorrow please wait  in early voting we have had people waiting in line for two and three hours and there have been reporters and others going up and down the line as people all kinds amans not one type all types why are you here because my future depends on it they say
 so tomorrow is the election but that is just the beginning we have to heal this country we have to bring people together listen and respect each other now i know it's unusual for somebody running for president to say this i star saying this months ago because i literally was meeting people who were scared by what they were hearing in the election you know i've known a lot of the s who've run for president been elec president in recent history i didn't agree with them on everything obviously we had our differences but i didn't doubt that they were fit to serve as president this election's different this person is temperamentally unqualified experientially unqualified to be president and commanderinchief and so many people know that  so i think we do need some more love and kindness right  we have got to rise above all of this hatefilled rhetoric all of these insults and scapegoating and fingerpointing and insulting i want to be the president for all amans not just some i want to be the president for s s and independents  i want to be the president for those who vote for me and those who vote against me i want to represent everybody  because i know we have a role to play in building a better future so it starts tomorrow if you don't know where to vote go to iwillvotecom you can get all the information you need the polls will be open from seven am to eight pm we are on track as i said to have a huge turnout but we can only do that if all of you make up your minds you bring your friends everybody you know to make sure your voices are heard this is a historic election and we're going to do everything we can not only to win but then immediately to get to work and i especially  i especially invite anyone who wants to volunteer for the next  hours go to com text join join join to  stop by one of our offices we would love to see you because when your kids and your grandkids ask you in the future what you did in  when everything was on the line you'll be able to say you vo for a stronger fairer better ama where we build bridges not walls  and where we finally inaudible for all that love s hate
 love s hate
 thank you   presidential candidate delivers remarks at a campaign event in kent ohio

 wow thank you so much and hello kent state  and happy halloween everybody it is great to be back in ohio even if the world series is ma life very stressful for cubs fans everywhere laughter i want to thank bruce blair for that introduction and for his service to our nation i think every aman should hear his story over the next eight days before they vote i also want to thank everyone who was part of the preprogram in particular let me thank senator sherrod brown such a great senator  my dear friend and great congressman    state representative  boccieri  state representative kathleen clyde  and let me thank kent clark the acapella group that sang during the preprogram  my friends we are about to enter the final week of this election so i wan to come back to ohio one of the most competitive and consequential battleground states in the country to talk about what's at stake in this election but let me start with this i'm sure a lot of you may be as what this new email story is about and why in the world the fbi would decide to jump into an election with no evidence of any wrongdoing with just days to go  that's a good question and first of all for those of you who are concerned about my using personal email i understand and as i've said i'm not ma excuses i've said it was a mistake and i regret it and now they apparently want to look at emails of one of my staffers and by all means they should look at them and i am sure they will reach the e conclusion they did when they looked at my emails for the last year there is no case here  and they said it wasn't even a close call and i think most people have decided a long e ago what they think about all of this now what people are focused on is choosing the next president and commander in chief of the uni states of ama  and did any of you see the debates  well i think it was important because i had a chance to talk about my  years of public service and my plans for our country and then people could weigh that against what my opponent has done and said i am running against a man who says he doesn't understand why we can't use nuclear weapons he actually said then why are we ma them and he wants more countries to have nuclear weapons japan south korea even saudi arabia imagine imagine nuclear weapons smack in the middle of the middle east and if you're telling yourself he'll surround himself with smart people who will stop these crazy ideas remember this when he was asked who he consults on foreign policy   said he didn't need to consult because and i quote i have a very good brain laughter he says he knows more about isis than our generals do no he does not laughter and of course the people   has around him include two men whose activities are reporly being investiga for their ties to russia   and 's allies so in these last days let's not get distrac from the real choice in this election and the consequences for your future  i star saying last june i believe that   has proven himself to be temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be president and commander in chief  and i've got to tell you i did not take any pleasure in saying that i have known i have known for years now people who ran for president s and s and i have my differences with s and even with s but i never doub their fitness to serve   is different that's as serious as it gets so today i want to talk about national security because when the election is over and people wake up on november th we will have picked the person who will carry the responsibility for all of these weighty decisions and that should really convince anyone how high the stakes are in this election i just want to focus on three of the most crucial questions facing the next president can you be trus to command our nuclear arsenal and make literally lifeanddeath decisions about war and peace how do you handle a crisis and do you know the difference between our allies and our adversaries  we'll start with nuclear weapons now i know there are some who will say that any discussion of this topic could be fearmongering but i don't think so and in part because of what you just heard from bruce blair when dozens of retired nuclear launch officers publicly state that   should and i quote not have his finger on the button then this is a topic that can't be avoided and as i've said  has repealy sugges more countries should have nuclear weapons he must not realize or care that the more nuclear material there is in the world the more likely terrorists are to get their hands on it or that someone will miscalculate and start a war that can't be stopped and when a few more countries go nuclear their neighbors will feel pressure to do so as well one of the reasons i worked so hard to impose sanctions on iran so that we could get them to the negotiating table was so we would not have a nuclear arms race in the middle east and i am proud that we put a lid on iran's nuclear weapons program  but even the prospect of an actual nuclear war doesn't seem to bother   good luck enjoy yourselves folks was what he had to say about a potential nuclear conflict in asia i wonder if he knows that a single nuclear warhead can kill millions of people these are weapons today far more powerful than the bombs that destroyed hiroshima and nagasaki during world war ii to talk so casually so cavalierly about mass annihilation is truly appalling president ronald reagan once said and he worked hard for arms control and i admired what he did wor with the soviet union and he once said he feared and this is a quote from president reagan some fool or some maniac or some accident triggering the kind of war that is the end of the line for all of us that has been the fear and the commitment of  and  presidents since the dawn of the atomic age so what would he think about   who says he wants to be and quote unpredictable about using the most powerful weapons ever produced and here's the thing with nuclear weapons as bruce told you when the president gives the order that's it there's no veto for congress no veto by the joint chiefs the officers in the silos have no choice but to fire and that can take as little as four minutes that's why all those retired launch officers stepped forward and said   should never be put in charge of our nuclear arsenal and when you heard from bruce blair his story is worth remembering in  bruce was a young military officer wor in an underground bunker in montana his job was to launch as many as  nuclear weapons if the president ever gave the order then one night in october as the uni states and the soviet union squared off over an escalating conflict in the middle east the emergency message he had trained for arrived prepare for nuclear war like other aman officers in bunkers and submarines and bombers around the world bruce and his colleagues star the process because that was their duty they unlocked the safe they took out the launch codes and the keys and then strapped into their chairs to brace for the shockwaves that would come if a russian warhead detona above them then they wai for the final order from the president thankfully it never came but when bruce looks at   he sees his hairtrigger temper and he thinks about what it felt like inside that bunker that night as i've said many es a man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons  and that brings me to the second question i think voters should ask about both candidates how do you handle a crisis we've seen in this campaign that   loses his cool at the slightest provocation when he's gotten a tough question from a reporter when he's challenged in a debate when he sees a protester at a rally when he's confron with his own words so imagine him in the oval office facing a real crisis imagine his advisers afraid to tell him what he doesn't want to hear racing against his legendarily short attention span laughter  to lay out lifeanddeath choices too complex to be reduced to a single tweet  and then imagine him plunging us into a war because somebody got under his very thin skin now thankfully he's never been in a position where he had to help make lifeanddeath decisions for our country but there was one national crisis where we did get a good look at how   handles himself  is a new yorker and his finest moment in this campaign was when he defended new york against  's attacks in a debate and he invoked the days after / when new yorkers really came together to take care of each other i couldn't agree more that's why it was so upsetting to learn what  was actually doing on / after the world watched with horror as the twin towers fell he called in to a new york tv station and even on that horrible day when thousands of people lost their lives he couldn't stop himself from pointing out that now because the towers had fallen a building he owned was the tallest in lower manhattan what kind of person brags at a moment like that i'll tell you someone who should never set foot in the oval office and serve as commander in chief  you know for me i take this very personally my friends because i was one of new york's senators along with chuck schumer on / he and i were on the ground the very next day meeting with the governor the mayor emergency officials and i will never forget the site of ground zero the thick smoke made it hard to breathe or see some of the firefighters and other first responders we met had been on duty nonstop since the planes hit the towers they had all lost friends in a makeshift command center we were briefed on the damage and it was clear we were going to need a lot of help to recover new york and we were going to have to really make it our absolute mission to not only rebuild new york but to keep ama safe that's what i did for eight years as a senator i never stopped fighting to keep our country safer and to ensure that first responders got the medical care they needed  and i think it's important to reflect on what each of us has done in moments like that because a lot of the crises that come at a president are not predic they happen i'll tell you a quick story it was after presidentelect  asked me to be secretary of state but before the inauguration and i got a call to come to an emergency meeting in the white house in the situation room and the new  national security team was on one side of the table and the outgoing  national security team was on the other side and the  administration had gotten credible intelligence that there was going to be an attack at our inauguration so even before we were swornin to do our jobs we were faced with helping to make such a consequential decision it really matters what your experience has been what your values are whether you can be coun on to make that decision you learn a lot about people in moments like that and as i sat there with the pressure on having to think through in my own head how we evalua this intelligence how we did everything we could to preserve our inauguration of our first africanaman president on the mall in washington   we made the decision to go forward obviously some of you might have been there but we also did everything we could to double our efforts to find out about the intelligence and to secure the hundreds of thousands of people who would be there so you have to ask yourself in a crisis who would you trust who will listen to good advice keep a level head and make the right call because that's the person you want as our president and commander in chief  now let's get to the third question for all of the voters to consider about each of us do you know the difference between our allies and our adversaries now this may seem like an easy question if you got it on an exam i think you'd be able to answer it laughter but apparently it's hard for  he has picked fights with our friends i mean the president of mexico the british prime minister the german chancellor pretty much the entire nation of japan laughter and he even picked a fight with the pope laughter and at the e e he is praising tyrants and dictators like saddam hussein and kim jongun in north korea and bashar alassad for their supposed strong leadership he even praised the chinese government for massacring protesters in tienanmen square   has repealy sugges he would abandon our allies in europe and asia he's called nato quote obsolete obsolete nato is the greatest military alliance in the history of the world and it's based on something  it's based on something called article five which says an attack on one is an attack on all and article five has only been invoked one e when our allies came to our defense after / we still have nato allies fighting sidebyside wor sidebyside with aman troops in afghanistan they joined us in going after al qaida and bin laden now we're supposed to tell them we won't have their back and by the way right now our nato allies are helping identify and track terrorists who threaten ama and europe they're hosting radar and missile defense installations that protect us against potential threats from iran and elsewhere and as our nato forces in afghanistan stand shouldertoshoulder with aman troops they share the risks and burdens now they're moving into the baltic states to deter russian aggression treating our allies like the small businesses and contractors that  exploi and stiffed in atlantic city hanging them out dry would make our country and our world less safe  and it would also play right into the hands of russia and china which are envious of our alliances and eager to see them weaken and fail but maybe that's the point because what's most stri about all of this and i would argue most important for voters to consider is the relationship between   and russian president   as former secretary madeline albright put it and i quote here we have never seen a mind meld of the kind between the russian leadership and a candidate for the presidency of the uni states  morell who ran the cia and grew up just a few miles from here has said that  is manipulating   is a trained intelligence officer from the old kgb he knows he can use flattery to get into 's head to make  the kremlin's puppet and it seems to be wor  has signaled to  that he will let russia do whatever it wants from ukraine to syria and beyond he's even said  is a stronger leader than president    and it gets worse the us intelligence community has now confirmed that the russian government which means  is directing cyberattacks against targets in the uni states to influence the outcome of our election so ask yourself why would  be trying to get   elec president could it be because of all the nice things  has said about him or the fact that he has promised to adopt pro kremlin policies or maybe because of the extensive business dealings with russian oligarchs with ties to  now since  won't release his tax returns and don't hold your breath laughter  we don't know the full extent of his business relationships but what we know is disturbing and we know this we are dealing with something unpreceden in the history of our country a foreign adversary trying to influence our presidential election that should scare everyone   and independent and with the election just eight days away this can't wait any longer   should immediately disclose all of his ties and connections to the kremlin and its associates  the aman people deserve to know the full extent of these links and how they relate to what the russians are doing in our election because when you step back and take it all in it's no surprise that   national security experts wrote an open letter saying they will not vote for   because he would be in their words the most reckless president in aman history and it's no surprise that not a single former president secretary of state or national security adviser from either party has endorsed him  and it's no surprise that bob  bob  who served eight presidents over  years s and s alike has said  is and i quote beyond repair stubbornly uninformed about the world and how to lead our country and government temperamentally unsui to lead our men and women in uniform unqualified and unfit to be commander in chief unquote  so i  you and voters across ohio and ama will think about all of these national security issues when you cast your vote in this election think about what it takes to lead and how we want to secure the safety of our country our children and our grandchildren and who's best prepared to do that because make no mistake that really is what's on the ballot this year it's not just my name and  's name it's our future our security our values it's who we are as a country   has a dark and divisive vision for ama that could tear our country apart but the good news is there's another vision for ama instead of dark and divisive it's ful and inclusive and opistic and unifying  and it is bighear not smallminded it is about lifting people up not tearing each other down  it is a vision that says as i believe in my heart a vision that says we are stronger together millions of people across our country are standing up and saying we believe in ama that is great because it is good that's s s independents because we believe in an ama where women are respec   an ama where veterans are honored parents are suppor workers are paid fairly   an ama where marriage is a right and discrimination is wrong   an ama that leads in the world and lives up to our values where everyone counts everyone has a place where the aman dream is big enough for everyone this goes way beyond politics and partisanship we're really tal about what it means to be an aman in the st century about the basic lessons we want to teach boys and girls our kids and grandkids it turns out if you dig deep enough through all the mud of politics eventually you hit something hard and true a foundation of fundamental values that unite us as amans   basic beliefs about equality and opportunity and freedom and common decency that is something to defend and build on and in the end that is what this election is all about and here in ohio you can make the difference early voting has already begun so now is the e  every phone call you make every door you knock on moves us forward you can go to com and volunteer you can text join to  to do the e you know somees if you've studied history you know the fate of the greatest nations comes down to single moments in e this is one of those makeorbreak moments for the uni states  and it truly is in your hands as it should be so when your kids and grandkids ask what you did in  when everything was on the line i  you'll be able to say i vo for a better stronger fairer ama a place where our future will be crea and char by people who have confidence that the best days of ama are still ahead of us particularly young people who i believe absolutely should help make that future  so let's come together let us make clear that we're going to stand up for an ama that we believe in because that ama believes in us and we're going to prove once and for all that love s hate thank you   presidential candidate delivers remarks at a campaign event in manchester new hampshire (sd/)

 you know the way i see it what elections are about is they ulately come down to our values it's not about one person or one candidate it's about a movement it's about a strong powerful movement to make real change in this country the kind of change that we make together and since we're here together let us remind ourselves why we get up in the morning why we work hard all day and why we're still wor late at night because of what we believe we believe that every person should be able to get a college education without getting crushed by student loan debt and that means refinancing our student loans and debtfree college yes  we believe that no one should work full e and live in poverty and that means raising the minimum wage and we will fight for it  we believe that workers should be able to organize for better pay for better wor conditions unions built ama's middle class and unions will rebuild ama's middle class yes  we believe that after a lifee of hard work people are entitled to retire with dignity and that means protecting and expanding social security and we will do it  you know you may have heard wells fargo chea tens of thousands of people giant banks brought down our economy well we believe in tough rules real accountability and if a ceo breaks the law they ought to go to jail just like anyone else  some beliefs are controversial so i want to throw this one out there we believe in science  we believe that climate change is real and that we have a moral obligation to protect this earth for our children and our grandchildren and our grandchildren's grandchildren yes  boy and i can't believe i have to say this in  we believe in equal pay for equal work and a woman's right to decisions about her own body yes  we believe that equal means equal and that's true in marriage it's true in the workplace it's true for every place and we will fight for equality for all of our people  you know   calls africanamans thugs he calls muslims terrorists he calls latinos criminals he brags about sexually assaulting women well we believe that racism and sexism and bigotry have no place in our country we believe that black lives matter and that we won't build  's stupid wall we believe diversity makes us strong yes  you do know i can do this all day  but we got a great speaker here so i'm going to do one more and then i'm going to quit we believe that millionaires and ionaires and giant corporations should not be able to buy our elections and our politicians corporations are not people we will overturn citizens uni and bring democracy back to the people yes  this is 's agenda this is maggie's agenda this is colin and annie and carol's agenda it is a progressive agenda it is a new hampshire agenda it is an aman agenda   is ready to fight for us are you ready to fight for   then let's welcome to the stage   our next president of the uni states
 thank you  thank you wow well i don't know about you but i could listen to  go on all day  it is so great being here back in new hampshire  i have a significant unruly group of women i went to wellesley with back here  oh and it's wonderful to be on this college campus and to see so many young people here as maggie and  and i were wal out to the stage a lot of folks were hanging out of the windows and we're glad that you've got the best view of what we're doing here it's also exciting to be here with two weeks left because this is the most consequential election of our lifee and to see the energy and the enthusiasm that this crowd displays  i saw it yesterday in north carolina i saw it the day before in ohio it really does demonstrate that amans are loo at what's at stake and are coming to the conclusion that we all have to be involved involved in the remaining days of the campaign and that everyone needs to turn out to vote and here in new hampshire you have a lot of reasons to vote you've got great candidates for the congress annie kuster and carol shea porter who deserve your support  and you've got a great candidate for governor colin van ostern thank you  i know that  you know maggie and  and i have been out here giving the full dose but i  you will also make sure people know what's at stake in the governor's race and in sending these two extraordinary women to the house and boy it is exciting to be here with maggie and  because they are people who fight for you every single day i know both of these women and it is a privilege to be on this stage with them now   has a track record of ma it her mission to stand up against wall street and she's going to make sure that wall street never wrecks main street again  but you may not know that she was the person behind setting up the agency that protects consumers the consumer financial protection bureau and it was set up to stand against and do something about the kinds of fraud and abuse we've seen from wells fargo and they are on the front lines of returning ions of dollars to amans who have been chea and defrauded by big companies by banks and others  you know in fact i think it's fair to say some of the best tv that you can see is on cspan when  is going after a bank executive or a regulator  she's refusing to let them off the hook and she's not just spea for herself is she
 no
 she is spea for every single aman who is frustra and fed up and i am so loo forward to wor with her to rewrite the rules of our economy to make sure we both grow it and make it fairer for every single person wor hard here in ama  i don't know  we're up here without our phones so we can't check tweets but laughter i kind of expect if  heard what she just said he's tweeting away she gets under his thin skin like nobody else  whether she's calling him out about his mysterious tax returns she exposes him for what he is  temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be president of the uni states  and maggie is going to be a great uni states senator for new hampshire
 you know you don't have to take my word or 's word look at what she has already done under maggie's leadership new hampshire has the lowest unemployment rate in the entire country  during her governorship it was ranked as the best state in the country for business and she's done it the new hampshire way she has brought people together s s and independents i think she has the biggest legislature probably in the world that she has to deal with so she has really honed her skills about listening and then trying to work with people and she's taken on issues that really do keep families up at night from the skyrocketing costs of college and prescription drugs to helping students figure out ways to afford to get their education to helping those suffering from addiction or mental health to raising wages for hardwor families what i love about maggie is that she is independent she knows how to find common ground and how to stand her ground and that is exactly the kind of leader we need in the uni states senate  because we've got to break through the gridlock and the dysfunction that has unfortunately marred washington we have got to get back to listening respectfully we can disagree without being disagreeable and that's why we need leaders like maggie and unlike her opponent she has never been afraid to stand up to    she knows he shouldn't be a role model for our kids or for anybody else for that matter so i  in these next  days you do everything you can to support her and i want to say a word about colin who i have also known for a number of years now and maggie is leaving some big shoes  she doesn't look like it but she is she's leaving some big shoes to fill as governor and colin is the person for that job you know as a member of the executive council and i remember this because it took a lot of guts he helped lead the fight to protect funding for planned parenthood in new hampshire  against his opponent by the way and he has shown that he will stand up for women's health  percent of the e not just when it's politically convenient he also worked with maggie to cross party lines to help expand medicaid to more than  granite staters  and colin wants to do more to invest in clean energy like wind and solar to hold down energy costs to create more good jobs here in new hampshire and to protect the beautiful environment of this state and he will fight to put into action the promise of higher education within reach for more families so please during these next days make sure you're doing everything you can for colin for carol and for annie  now did anybody see the last debate
 yeah 
 you know i stood next to   in three debates for four and a half hours proving once again that i have the stamina to be president  i tried to use the e i had in all three to talk about what people talk to me about starting here in new hampshire and going across the country because i take it really seriously i think the problems that keep you up at night that stand in the way of your getting ahead and staying ahead of providing the best opportunity of a good middleclass job with a rising income for you and your kids those are the problems that someone running for president should actually listen to pay attention to and come up with solutions for  so you know i do have a lot of plans i do and i get criticized for having so many plans   and i have actually written a book  oh there's one copy right there it's called  oh another copy it's called stronger together and we lay out all of our plans for what we want to do if we're so honored as to be president and vice president
 and you know i do have this old fashioned idea that if i'm here as for your vote to be your president i should tell you what i'm going to do and  and maybe as i said yesterday in north carolina maybe it is a bit of a woman's thing because we make lists laughter we do we make lists and we try to write down what we're supposed to do and them cross them off as we go through the day and the week and so i want you to think about our plans as our lists our list as a country we are going to get the economy wor for everybody not just those at the top we are going to make college affordable we are going to lower prescription drug costs and we're going to do everything we can to keep faith with what we have said we're going to do what a novel idea we're actually going to try to deliver results for you  but i got to tell you during that debate  said something  well he said a lot of things that were troubling but he said something truly horrifying he became the first person running for president  or  who refused to say that he would respect the results of this election now that is a direct threat to our democracy i'm not going to try to call it anything else because that's what it is all this talk about the election being rigged trying to stir up people who are supporting him at his rallies that is a direct threat to our democracy and i got to tell you as your secretary of state i went to  countries and i went to countries where people were jailed for being political opponents where they were exiled where they were killed i take this really seriously and for me the peaceful transfer of power is one of the things that makes our country great something that   something we can't lose something we shouldn't even doubt we cannot give into cynicism and i don't think we are i'll tell you what's exciting to me is across this country at the very moment when   is ma this unpreceden attack on our fundamental values our institutions millions of people are standing up for democracy registering volunteering voting early  so when you get a little discouraged or you get frustra by what you see in this campaign think of this we have just reached a historic milestone more than  million amans are now registered to vote  and most exciting that includes more than  million young people the biggest number ever  now you only see numbers like this when people are standing up for what they believe in and i'm proud to see amans coming together s s independents to reject hate and division and you know we're seeing that in new hampshire too we are more than our disagreements we amans there is so much more that unites us than divides us i'm proud to have the support of more than   leaders in this state who put country before party  but this energy we're seeing is not just because of what we're against as important as that is it's because what we're for it's about fighting for a future where everyone counts where everyone has a place and no one is left out or left behind because to me  and i  to you as well  this is about more than winning an election it's about the kind of country we want for our kids and our grandkids that's what this has to be about
 it's about the lessons we want to pass on to our sons and our daughters you know we believe we should honor the men and women who fight for our country and that ama is safer when we work with our allies to lead the world with strength and intelligence yet my opponent attacked a grieving gold star family whose son died in iraq he has no plan to defeat isis and just last night he twee that the new effort underway to push the terrorists out of the key city of mosul is already and i quote a total disaster and that our country is quote loo so dumb  imagine imagine you know this is a guy who says he knows more about isis than the generals i don't think so he's basically declaring defeat before the battle has even star he's proving to the world what it means to have an unqualified commanderinchief it's not only wrong it's dangerous and it needs to be repudia on november th here in new hampshire and across ama  but just in case you think that this is new for  it shouldn't surprise you or surprise anybody else and i'll tell you why he has been denigrating ama for decades it star before he ran against me it star before president  took office in fact back in  he spent $ on an ad in the new york es criticizing president reagan he said and i quote the world is laughing at ama does that sound familiar this is someone who roots for failure and takes glee in moc our country no matter who our president is now that may be who   is but this election is about who we are and i want us  i want us to remember ama is great because ama is good right  and as our wonderful first lady   said right here in new hampshire when they go low we go high  this election poses a very clear choice on the economy when the middle class thrives ama thrives as  said she is a perfect example of how that works in ama so am i so are every one of you here that's what i want for every single person especially young person in ama with your help we're going to not only have  back in the senate but send maggie send carol send annie and then make the biggest investment in new jobs since world war ii  what does that mean that means jobs and infrastructure our roads our bridges our tunnels our ports our mass transit our water system there's a lot of great work to be done here and guess what those are jobs that can't be expor they've got to be done right here in new hampshire and across ama  i want us to invest in advanced manufacturing and there are i know a lot of skeptics about that they say well we can't compete in manufacturing any more well i'll tell you what i don't want us competing with low wage jobs i want us competing for the high wage jobs germany is a major exporter of advanced manufacturing products i want to compete with germany and countries like that precision machining d printing  i want us to invest more in technology innovation and research and yes in clean energy because we're going to make ama a clean energy super power of the st century  i think we can deploy a half a ion more solar panels within the first four years and enough clean energy to power every home by the end of  years that's what i want people to be wor on and thin about and striving to achieve
 and i am really exci about what we can do to make sure every young aman is prepared i want to start in the early years of life in early education universal prek i want kids to be prepared to succeed   because we are in a competition and you know what i want us to step up and compete and win and i want our schools i want kids to have good teachers and good schools in every zip code and i want to be a good partner with our teachers and our educators here in new hampshire  and i want to bring back technical education to high school i think we really  we really shut the door on too many young people who could have gotten skills that would have given them the chance to get ahead and wor with our community colleges we need to make sure that every young person and every person coming back to upgrade or change skills can go to a community college and yes we are going to make fouryear college affordable you know just this week a new report came out showing that new hampshire students have very high levels of debt and i know maggie has been fighting that and she's had a moratorium and she's done what she could at the state level but we got to work together at the national level to make this happen for students in new hampshire families in new hampshire  so after our primary was over and  you know what i was really proud i was really proud of the campaign that   and i ran and it was a  it was a campaign   it was a campaign about ideas not insults and that's what campaigns should be about and after it was over  and i got together we put our heads together and we came up with a plan to make public colleges and universities tuitionfree for any families ma less than $ a year  and if you make more than that it will be debtfree in other words pay what you can but let's not have kids and families going into debt to get an education this should be an investment that we make on behalf of them and our country's future  and no matter where you go to a great school like this or anywhere else we will help you pay down your student debt we'll make it easier because we're going to make it as a percentage of your income so you're never on the hook for more than you can afford and if you're interes to see how much you and your family could save you can actually go to com/calculator to see how much you can save under this plan that we are proposing  now i think in addition to growing the economy we need to do a lot more on small business twothirds of new jobs will come from small business so we're going to be just focused on how we make it possible to start and grow your small business and then we do  we do have to make the economy fair and that starts with raising the national minimum wage because if you work fulle i'm tal about fulle workers you shouldn't still be in poverty at the end work should provide a ladder of opportunity for people willing to work for it to climb right  and we are going to guarantee equal pay we are going to make affordable childcare so nobody pays more than  percent of your income for childcare we're going to work for paid family leave because this is the way families are today you know we're not living in the s families are under new stresses and strains and i meet so many who are really just at the edge they are ma all they can make one parent wor fulle two parents wor fulle somees parte on top of fulle and the other day   and i were in pittsburgh and there was a long line of people a big overflow which you know we couldn't get into the main room where we were so  was tal to the families there and there was a woman there holding her yearold child a daughter i think and you know  was sha hands and the woman looked he said i  she said i came here hoping i could tell you or secretary  that i had my baby three years ago and the day after i had my baby i was fired because i called and asked if i could have a few weeks because it had been a difficult pregnancy and my baby was fine but not all that she needed to be i got fired and  came in and you know he's such a wonderful man what a fine fine n being
 and he said to me you know there are reasons every day why i get so motiva in this election and i just  i just have another reason and he told me that story i think your president should care about that i think your president should wake up every day thin ok how do i help empower people to make the most out of their own lives you know how do i knock down the barriers that give you the chance to go as far as your hard work and talent will take you and then somees people say well how are you going to get all this done and  i have proposed plans that do not add a penny to the debt because i see some of my longe friends who were back in the ' campaign and you know when my husband ended up we had a balanced budget and a surplus  and actually we were on the way to paying down the national debt but here's what happened what happened is tickledown economics came back so here's what i'm gonna do we're going to ask the wealthy to finally pay their fair share  we're going to  we're gonna close the loopholes we are going to end the fact that millionaires can pay a lower tax rate than a nurse or a teacher or a police officer we're gonna make big banks pay for the risks they pose to our economy because  is absolutely right no  no bank is too big to fail and no one should be above the law  so we're going to enforce that and contrast that with   he believes if you give trillions  and that's trillions with a t  in tax cuts to the wealthy millionaires ionaires and corporations everything will work well it will for him that's tledown economics on steroids and he would wipe away the tough new rules that president  imposed on wall street he would eliminate the consumer financial protection bureau that  did so much to create  and you know that was bad enough but then in the debates we learned he has not paid any income tax for years  so he hasn't paid a penny to support our military our veterans pell grants for kids to get an education health or anything else and his explanation was well he lost $ ion in a year now i've pondered this i've really pondered this he actually said it made him smart not to pay income taxes but how smart are you to lose $ ion in a year  and  i don't  has anybody here ever been to a casino he lost $ ion running casinos who does that i've never heard of anybody laughter so we've got to make it clear that  is not on the side of aman workers or aman families you know for all of his talk about putting ama first he makes his products in at least  other countries he stiffs small businesses momandpop contractors who work for him my dad was a smallbusiness owner he worked really heard i'm just glad he never got a contract from   because it was hard work and people who do that work should be rewarded not taken advantage of so we  we know a lot about how   works and today  today we heard yet another story it's about a maintenance worker at one of his golf courses this maintenance worker told his coworkers he was gay and they star harassing him they used antigay slurs to his face they threw rocks and golf balls at him his supervisors saw it and did nothing and it got so bad he wound up in the hospital finally he went to the police for help he couldn't go back to work because he was too scared for his safety and then he was fired by 's golf club now this is a heartwrenching story on a lot of levels for starters it is a painful reminder of the harassment violence and discrimination that too many lgbt amans still face every day  and it is deeply disturbing that instead of stepping in to stop the tormentors 's golf club turned on the vic for coming forward
 if that's how   runs his business what does that say about how he would run our country so my friends there are lots of reasons so many to take this election seriously but here' what i want you to know of course i want you to vote for all of us but more than that i want you to vote for yourselves and for your families and for your  for our future together  because if you believe women and girls should be trea with dignity and respect and that women should be able to make our own health care decisions and that marriage equality should be protec and that we have to take on the epidemic of substance abuse disorders and addictions if you believe in a foreign policy where we work with our allies not insult them and achieve common goals toward peace and prosperity then you have to vote all of these issues are on the ballot this november and i believe with all my heart that we will after this election get together to help heal the divides that have sprung up and are so painful among us  so please register and vote on the e day go to iwillvotecom to confirm your polling place come help us these last two weeks go to com sign up to volunteer take out your phone text join  join to  and get everybody you know to come out and vote i think this election is going to turn on who is motiva to vote so we need each and every one of you to do everything you can to make it clear to everybody you know that our future is at stake if you want to be part of a positive opistic confident unifying future please come out and vote on november th here in new hampshire and prove once and for all that love s hate  thank you allformer secretary of state  rodham   presidential candidate delivers remarks at the th annual salute to labor

honor to be up on this stage with the people you see before you starting with my friend and former colleague the great senator from illinois dick durbin who has been in so many ways the conscience of the uni states senate you heard him say he comes from a union family he knows what hard work is he stands up every day in that senate i  you get a chance to watch him on cspan somee because he carries such passion and conviction in his voice about everything that he's fighting for so thank to our friends from illinois for sending dick durbin to the senate for all the years and for however long he wants to be there and please be sure he is joined by tammy duckworth as your next senator  dick  dick reminded me that i endorsed tammy here last year i was loo for the fight occasion to do that and i figured right here in her state would be the perfect opportunity i just can't tell you how much i admire this brave woman and she's going to bring so much to the senate to our national debate about issues that are critical to ama's future so please do everything you can to make sure that tammy is in the senate  and let me also recognize and thank your congresswoman cheri bustos thank you  cheri

presidents here and i said knowing these three they're happy to be here this is not some kind of labor day obligation they are with their members they're wor on behalf not only of those in the union

words i really believe we are stronger together that was the theme of our convention and coming out tomorrow   and i have a book called stronger together and i'll tell you why we did this book i think if you run for president you ought to tell people what you want to do right  and what i've tried to do in this book and it's so great having senator  by my side now is to lay out a blueprint for ama's future how are we going to get more good jobs infrastructure jobs advanced manufacturing jobs clean renewable energy jobs how are we going to make sure that the economy not only is growing and producing more jobs with rising incomes but is being fair so that people are trea fairly that's why we support we support raising the national minimum wage so that you're not living in poverty when you work full e  my opponent thinks wages are too high i don't know who he talks to but he actually says that and he doesn't believe in raising the national minimum wage i also believe in doing more to support small businesses my dad was a small businessman i believe that we need to do everything we can to help small businesses succeed   and i were together in cleveland earlier we talked about that 's dad ran a union shop iron workers and he's proud of that that he had a small business father who ran a union shop and employed union workers providing good products i also believe that we have to go finally guarantee equal pay for women's work  and that's because i believe in fairness i don't want to see anybody trea unfairly and discrimina against i don't care who you are if you're willing to work and do your part you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead that is the basic bargain of ama so if you look at this book which i  you will it stands in stark contrast to   he says i alone can fix it now the folks i have met during this campaign and for many years before know that we have challenges know we've got to come together and believe we have to work together to fix what our problems are that's my view i want us to bring people together just the way unions do just the way people in communities do and here in the quad cities and across the country we can see proof every day that we have to come together to meet our challenges so i'm going to continue to emphasize that we want to be the uniters in this campaign we believe that ama is already great and that we can become greater if we do our part  when somebody says i alone can fix it think of the people he's leaving out everybody else leaving out our troops on the front lines leaving out firefighters and police officers who run toward danger leaving our teachers and educators who do they best to change children's lives leaving out everybody else that is his campaign in a nutshell and what we've got to do in the next  days is to present the vision of ama we believe in so we're going to continue to say we're stronger together we're going to work together we're going to run a campaign of issues not insults and we are going to be absolutely strong in our support for unions because we know  nobody gets through life alone unions help build the largest middleclass in the history of the world in our country they fought for fair wages safe wor conditions they've helped so many people get on that run to the middleclass and their kids like dick durbin go even higher so i am going to say no to a tax on unions i am going to say no to rolling back collective bargaining i am going to say no to unfair trade deals like the tpp i'm going to say no  no to pension cuts that deny you the secure retirement that you have worked for and i'm going to say no to right to work it's not right for workers and it is not right for ama  but i will say yes to the aman dream and here's what i believe the aman dream is big enough for all of us if we build it we will expand it and create more opportunities and as we run this campaign on issues our most important  our most important goal is getting the economy to work for everybody there's nothing  nothing more important and how do you do that by creating more jobs and what are some of the areas that i think we can really emphasize infrastructure our roads our bridges our tunnels our ports our airports  also what we can't see our water systems our sewer systems we also need a new electric grid a modern electric grid to be able to take and distribute clean renewable energy i have a goal for us to install a half a ion more solar panels by the end of my first term  it takes a lot of  a lot of jobs a lot of people wor to do that and then enough clean energy to power every home by the end of my second term  i also want to finish the work of broadband interconnectivity we have places in our country that still have dialup we have places where kids can't do the homework assignments their teachers give them because they don't have access to the internet that is so unfair think of all the jobs we'll create when we finish that off and then let's look at advanced manufacturing i believe we can compete with anybody if we put our minds to it and i'm going to have a manufacturing renaissance policy that will put people to work  i  i am so proud that  and lonnie are here because they've been doing so much to really create the new industries and autos and what the ibew does in so many important areas of our economy i want to be your partner and i think it's especially important to recognize that when the chips were down and the auto industry was on its back president  did the right thing he saved the aman auto industry  i suppor him then and i support him just as strongly now the aman auto industry just had the best year it's had in a long e and that was because of the teamwork and the partnership that we had between the companies between the union and because the president of the uni states knew we had to save the auto industry   basically said he didn't care didn't matter to him it just shows you how he doesn't understand or care about the real jobs that put bread on the table and give people a sense of purpose and dignity well you won't have to look far to find me in the oval office if i'm fortunate enough to be your president and to do everything i can every single day to create more jobs to save jobs to bring jobs back from overseas  and if you contrast that with  his track record  his track record is just the opposite he actually hired a union busting firm for one of his hotels in las vegas he built a career out of not paying workers for the work they did we're tal painters plumbers electricians people who thought it was a big deal wor for   one of his resorts his casinos he stiffed them he stiffs small businesses like i said my dad was a small businessman he prin drapery fabrics he'd get an order he'd buy the material he'd get the silk screens made i would go somees to help him in his print plant he'd have these long tables the fabric would be laid out you would take the silk screen you'd put it down you'd pour the paint in you'd take the squeegee you'd push it across you'd lift the screen up you go all the way down get on the next table all the way back took a lot of e took a lot of hard work when he finished he'd load up the fabrics in his car and he'd go deliver them i am so happy he never got a contract from    i don't know what my family would've done if my dad did business with people like  who has told hundreds and hundreds of small business he's been sued  es for not paying the s that he owes if my dad had been told sorry just kidding we're not paying you  this is the man who wants to be president of the uni states this is someone who doesn't even honor contracts that's what is so dangerous about this election what   says what he says about the economy that he knows how to create jobs he had six bankruptcies in one bankruptcy alone  people lost their jobs the numbers add up he talks about wanting to protect jobs in ama but everything he makes he's made overseas he could have made suits and ties and furniture in the uni states but no he made it overseas he even hires workers from overseas and he tells people well he couldn't find amans who wan to work in the heat you can't make this stuff up can you it is truly unbelievable but what's even worse is what he says about foreign policy as bad as he is about our economy he has insul our allies he has made common cause with dictators he has basically endorsed   and his policies when he says i know more about isis than the generals when he claims our armed forces are a disaster or he insults a gold star family that's not just offensive that's dangerous and just today our intelligence professionals said there was credible evidence for them to pursue an investigation into russia's efforts to interfere with our election hac the  national comee and when  was asked about it didn't deny it in fact he said it was probably a good thing it happened and this is the person that   praises we saw even more evidence last week that he is temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be president in just a few hours he managed to turn his trip to mexico into an embarrassing international incident i mean just look at what happened he got into a twitter war with inaudible and why because the president of mexico said i told him in the meeting we weren't paying for that wall  so not only did  mess up his first international engagement he choked he couldn't even bring himself to tell the president of mexico one of his very few policy demands i mean he went back to arizona and gave another hatefilled speech about rounding up and deporting  million people even some of his own advisers are having a hard e explaining that away so he's going to try to distract and divide he's going to  that we don't pay attention to what he's been saying for   months and we just tune in now these last two months that he's somehow softening his positions that there's a really another   out there well you've got to ask yourself if you can't even go to a friendly foreign country without getting into a fight can this person even claim to have the temperament to be in the oval office and deal with real urgent crises as i've said before and i'll say it again a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not be anywhere nuclear weapons  but we have a lot of work to do i think every election is close and tight and tough that's why we have to work as hard as we can between now and when the last votes are coun and that's why i need your help i want to get the economy wor for everybody not just those at the top i want to be sure that we lead the world with strength and steadiness and that we protect ama here at home and around the world and i want to unify our country i believe with all my heart   that every aman must vote must vote i see a woman holding a sign you must vote please it will make a difference and then she says i'm a gold star daughter  god bless you god bless you i spent my life fighting for kids and families i don't give up i don't quit when we didn't get health care reform i went to work with s and s we passed the children's health insurance program that insures  million kids every year  as dick said after we were attacked on / i worked with s and s to make sure we could rebuild new york and the pentagon and make sure we were as safe as we possibly could be this election will determine so much about our future and one thing i know for sure is we have to start listening to and respecting each other again we may have differences that's the aman way but we are stronger together we can do anything if we put our minds to it i saw the picture of mother theresa that was being held up here and i was fortunate to know mother theresa i was fortunate enough to actually work with her we didn't agree on everything but we found common ground she asked me when i was first lady to get a home for babies star in washington so mothers who couldn't care for their babies could take their babies to a safe place and those babies could be adop  and when mother theresa asked you to do something the only answer was yes ma'am laughter and i star wor and she would call me she'd call me from india she'd call me from vietnam she called me from everywhere she'd say where's my home laughter and i'd say well mother wor with the washington dc zoning department requires divine intervention laughter and so she did and we got it done  here's what i  you will do i  you will get involved in this campaign for these last two months i  you will go to com and see how you can work in illinois in iowa i  you will text join  join and go to  to see what you can do we need everybody involved there has never been a more important consequential election in our lifees  and we need to elect progressive leaders like tammy and cheri and dave loebsack and others who are on the ballot as well i am confident and opistic about ama's future when i listened to   when i watched his convention i honestly did not know what country he was tal about it was so dark so dire so depressing that's not the ama i know it's not the ama that i see i don't deny that we have problems of course we do we're n beings but my goodness would you live anywhere else  would you give up our freedom our values our opportunity for anywhere else i traveled to  countries as your secretary of state and everywhere i went i was so proud to land that plane which said the uni states of ama on it and to come down those stairs and begin to meet on behalf of our values our interests and our security and there is not a place despite what they say that doesn't envy who we are and what we have we cannot put any of that at risk my friends  so for these last two months join this campaign help us make history make sure that we are continuing to be not just great but even greater and that we're creating opportunities for the next generation like my grandchildren that's what we can do together if we remember we are stronger together god bless youformer secretary of state  rodham   presidential candidate holds a news conference

 good morning good morning good morning everyone last night i was very glad to be able to begin a conversation with the aman people and offer some of my thoughts about isis iran and how we reform the va system to provide better care for our vets and i'm honored that in the last  hours more retired generals and admirals have decided to endorse my campaign to focus more on these crucial challenges tomorrow i'm convening a meeting of bipartisan national security leaders and experts including former secretaries of homeland security  chertoff and janet napolitano general  allen former acting director of the cia  morell and former nato supreme allied commander james stavridis and others we will discuss how to intensify our efforts to defeat isis and keep our country safe to that end i want to underscore something that i mentioned last night we should make it a top priority to hunt down the leader of isis abu bakr albaghdadi and bring him to justice just as we did with oa bin laden as with that operation getting albaghdadi will require a focused effort driven at the highest levels but i believe it will send a resounding message that nobody directs or inspires attacks against the uni states and gets away with it let me be clear last night was yet another test and   failed yet again we saw more evidence that he is temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be commander in chief he trashtalks aman generals saying they've been quote reduced to rubble he sugges he would fire them and replace them with his handpicked generals he attacked dozens of former flag officers by saying that quote we've sic been losing for us for a long e that's how he talks about distinguished men and women who have spent their lives serving our country sacrificing for us that's how he would act as commander in chief meanwhile bizarrely once again he praised russia's strongman   even ta the astonishing step of suggesting that he prefers the russian president to our aman president now that is not just unpatriotic and insulting to the people of our country as well as to our commander in chief it is scary because it suggests he will let  do whatever  wants to do and then make excuses for him
 i was just thin about all of the presidents that would just be loo at one another in total astonishment what would ronald reagan say about a  nominee who attacks ama's generals and heaps praise on russia's president i think we know the answer and when asked how he would stop the spread of global terrorism 's answer was simply take the oil the uni states of ama does not invade other countries to plunder and pillage we don't send our brave men and women around the world to steal oil and that's not even getting into the absurdity of what it would involve massive infrastructure large numbers of troops many years on the ground of course  hasn't thought through any of that every  holding or see office in this country should be asked if they agree with   about these statements now one thing you didn't hear from  last night is any plan to take on isis one of the biggest threats facing our country he says his plan is still a secret but the truth is he simply doesn't have one and that's not only dangerous it should be disqualifying so i have a very different vision for how we keep our country safe and strong i respect the men and women who put their lives on the line to serve ama i will work with our allies to defeat isis and i will hold true to our country's most cherished values you know even with all of the attention paid to the campaign we cannot forget how important this decision is this weekend is the th anniversary of / i will never forget the horror of that day but i will never forget either the vics and survivors and the brave first responders and emergency responders that i met with and served and worked for as senator from new york that's what kept me wor so hard in the senate on behalf of / families that's who i was thin of  years later in the white house situation room with president  when the decision was made to bring oa bin laden to justice that's the kind of commander in chief i will be someone who will bring us together in common purpose to keep our people safe and our country strong
 madam secretary the latest real clear politics average has you up by an average of  percentage points over   given what you say are his historic inadequacies and disqualification on the commander in chief point that you just made shouldn't you just basically be running away with it at this point 
 well as i've said many many es i've always thought this was going to be a close election that's why we've been putting organizations in place gearing up for these final weeks to mobilize and turn out our voters that's exactly what we're going to do and i feel we're in a strong position but we're not ta anyplace anyone anything for gran we're going to keep wor as hard as we can and fully pull out as many voters who agree with me as we possibly can muster crosstalk
 hi  
 you said unequivocally last night that you would not put troops into iraq ever again isn't a that ignoring some ground forces who are there and b boxing yourself in should your military commanders if elec advise that you in fact need to do that
 well   first of all i've said that before i've said it on numerous occasions i believe it i think putting a big contingent of aman ground troops on the ground in iraq and syria would not be in the best interest of the fight against isis and other terrorist groups in fact i think it would fulfill one of their dearest wishes which is to drag the uni states back into a ground war in that region however i've been very clear and i said this again last night i support the air campaign i support special forces i support enablers i support surveillance intelligence and reconnaissance i will absolutely be prepared to do whatever is necessary to support the arab and kurdish fighters on the ground to take out as much of the infrastructure of isis from the air to go after baghdadi as i said today with a very focused commitment to ta him off the battlefield
 i think the approach i've outlined intensifies what we are doing but also recognizes that there is no in my opinion path forward to ground troops that would be in our interests
 hi good morning secretary  you've been criticized by the rnc for your demeanor last night that you were too serious that you didn't smile enough can you react to that and also you sugges that there is a double standard do you think that you're trea differently in this race because you're a woman
 well i'm going to let all of you ponder that last question i think there will be a lot of phd theses and popular journalism writing on that subject for years to come i don't take my advice and i don't take anything seriously that comes from the rnc we were tal about serious issues last night i know the difference between what we have to do to fix the va what we have to do to take the fight to isis than just ma political happy talk and i had a very short window of e in that event last night to convey the seriousness with which i would approach the issues that concern our country   chose to talk about his deep admiration and support for   maybe he did it with a smile and i guess the rnc would've liked that
 thank you madam secretary
 like the hat
 appreciate that
 is this a new look
 no its kind of an old look now
 oh you're bringing it back
 i'm bringing it back
 went shopping in your closet 
 you got it
 yeah i do a lot of that
 last night mr  sugges in some of his security briefings that briefers made a suggestion or an insinuation that they were not pleased  the cia was not pleased with the decisions that the administration and president  have made so far did you get that e impression in the briefings that you got and can you comment otherwise on that suggestion from mr 
 i think what he said was totally inappropriate and undisciplined i would never comment on any aspect of an intelligence briefing that i received
  different standard and what does that mean for you going into the debate
 that's a very fair question i  i have been somewhat heartened by the number of articles recently pointing out the quite disparate treatment of  and his campaign compared to ours i don't understand the reasons for it i find it frustrating but its just part of the landscape that we live in and we just keep forging ahead look i  i think this is a really important moment for everybody in our country as you have seen by the numbers of s concerned about  coming forward and saying this is not acceptable they are willing to put their names out there people who've never endorsed a  people who've never endorsed before because they are so concerned about this man and how totally unqualified he is to be president and how totally temperamentally unfit he is to be commander in chief so i know that he says outrageous things on a you know pretty regular basis and i know that's part of the coverage and i know that it may be difficult to feel that you know exactly how to respond to some of his behavior but we're on the brink of ma a very critical decision for our country and if i were not the candidate if i were not the nominee if i were just a concerned citizen i'd be out here doing everything i could to sound the alarm about someone like   getting anywhere near the white house and i will continue to do that
 thanks guys
 well you could look on the map and find aleppo
 madam secretary  
 i love you andrea you are indefatigable you're my kind of woman i'll tell you what look at this ok i know go ahead i mean the sympathy vote the whole thing i love it
 
 yes
 
 matt olsen right right
   
 right right
 
 no that's not true
 
 well you know look i mean the s are just in a terrible dilemma trying to support a totally unqualified nominee i have no sympathy for them it's their nominee but i am not going to tolerate them continuing to make misleading inaccurate accusations and putting out misinformation about me and here's the latest example matt olsen the very distinguished and effective former director of the national counterterrorism center was so disturbed by what he has seen coming from the  campaign that he wrote an article that i guess came online in the last  hours pulling from public sources very clear statements by isis leaders essentially throwing whatever support they have to   they have as matt olsen poin out said they d that allah delivers ama to  they have said that they  that he is the president because it would give even more motivation to every jihadi someone who has insul muslims has insul a gold star family of an incredibly heroic captain khan someone who has said he doesn't want to let muslims around the world even come to our country that is a gift for isis and that is what matt olsen who knows more about this than the s trying to somehow muddy the waters very clearly sta that's what i mean and look i'm not as for any special treatment i  i know the road that i'm on i've been on it for  years and i just get up every day and keep moving forward i love this country i will serve it with my entire heart mind and soul i will do everything i can to protect ama and i will do everything i can to make sure   is not president for many reasons but this latest information coming from a distinguished counterterrorism expert should put every aman's mind in motion to try to figure out what everyone can do to prevent  from being the president
 thanks everybody
 thank you   presidential candidate delivers remarks at a campaign event in akron ohio

 thank you wow hello akron wow i am so exci it's just fabulous being back here again i am so grateful to all of you i want to thank your mayor mayor horrigan thank you for welcoming me here i want to thank two great members of congress who fight for akron fight for cleveland fight for youngstown fight for ohio and ama congresswoman marsha fudge and congressman    now i'm pretty exci about being here today and i was especially honored to receive the endorsement of lebron james  now i may become president but he will be  of ohio for as long as there is a  i'm obviously deligh to be endorsed by someone who has demonstra such leadership and such extraordinary ability but i'll tell you what really moved me the most is he's given back to his hometown  he has advoca for small businesses for kids given kids more opportunities he's spoken out on behalf of criminal justice reform he is someone who uses the platform he has earned because he has worked so hard over so many years to speak out and speak up for those who may not have a voice so i am truly honored to have his support and especially to be able to tell people in his hometown how i am loo forward not just to watch him play basketball but to continue to be a leader in so many different ways now we do  we do have an important election coming up  who here is planning to vote  well that is very good news because this is the most consequential election i think in our lifees the choice could not be clearer and we need everybody to show up and how many of you still have to register to be able to vote everybody here registered  well i want you to talk to your friends because the deadline for registering in ohio is october th that's just a little over a week away and if you are not sure whether or not someone you know is registered or maybe you yourself want to be absolutely positive you can go to iwillvotecom see that sign over there you can go to iwillvotecom and confirm your registration and register if you need to so let's get everybody you know to register and maybe start voting when early voting starts on october th  because we have just  days left thirtysix days now we are reaching out we're ma phone calls we're knoc on doors if you want to get involved you can go to my website com sign up to be part of this campaign in the next  days you can text join  join  at  and get involved because we are running to win ohio in this election 
   
 and you know everybody everybody in the campaign is crisscrossing ohio my daughter has been here a bunch    and his wonderful wife ann have been here  my husband is coming back tomorrow for a twoday bus tour through ohio  and i will be back because we care about ohio and we want to make sure ohio makes the best choice for the future of the people of this great state  now i'm going to close this campaign the way that i star my career a long e ago fighting for kids and families standing up for people who may need a little extra boost in life ma sure that this country delivers on the promise of the aman dream see i believe the aman dream is big enough for everybody  if you're willing to work for it and do your part you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead in ama  now my opponent and i have a really different view about what it takes to get ahead and stay ahead and that may be because we have very different life experiences and you know that's ok people have different families different views of the world but here's what i have noticed i have noticed that he always puts himself first and maybe that's because he was born into a millionaire family he star his business with a $ million loan from his father his father bailed him out apparently that's a pattern you've got to be bailed out when you do business with him and he then has taken advantage of every single element of our tax code of our economy that he could and along the way  along the way he has stiffed people small businesses and workers and contractors and that's part of the reason i take this election so seriously my dad was a small businessman my grandfather was a factory worker and so my dad when he got out of the navy in world war ii he star a small business he star a printing business he prin fabrics for draperies and you know he worked really hard he had a print plant in chicago no natural light no windows just a long room where there were two big long tables and the fabric would be laid out on them and then if you've ever seen silkscreens that's what he did you take the silkscreen you put it down you pour the paint in your take the squeegee you go across you lift it up you go down to the end of one long table you start on the end of the other long table and then if it was going to be two colors you would add another color doing exactly the e thing it was before there was machines my dad couldn't have afforded that anyway but he worked really hard and he produced a good middle class life for our family so when i think about the way that my opponent has taken advantage of people i've got to tell you i am really grateful my dad never got a contract from him laughter because i have met people he stiffed i have met people i'm tal painters and plumbers i'm tal dishwashers marble installers glass installers architects a man who sold him pianos for one of his casinos he wouldn't pay them now you've got to stop and ask yourself what kind of person does that somebody who works hard and has a contract which they expect to be honored and so i met one of the men i met a man who had a small family business installed the glass in one of those casinos submit the  and  said no we're not going to pay it and the man was stunned as so many hundreds and hundreds of people have been and then they come back the  organization or  himself and say ok we'll give you  cents  cents maybe  cents on the dollar now some of those small businesses couldn't afford that they had bought the material they had provided the services  didn't care he basically just walked away from them made them feel like they had failed even though they had done the work they'd been asked to provide i've got to tell you that is not the way we're supposed to do business in ama and  and i can't imagine having a president who believes that that's the way you're supposed to treat people but you're going to help me make sure he never gets near the white house  
   
 now earlier today earlier today in toledo i talked about all of the changes i want to make in how we can protect amans from the kind of corporate fraud that we have seen too much of now the most recent example is wells fargo  wells fargo actually had people thousands of their employees putting customers into accounts they either never asked for or they did not understand and then every e they put somebody into a new account they got fees which then gave them the chance to get a bigger bonus a really crummy game that hurt people so thankfully we have an organization now the consumer finance protection bureau in washington that looks out for people who get defrauded like that  that is an important part of how we are going to protect people and it is run you may know by richard cordray from ohio  now will it surprise you that   wants to eliminate that agency
 no
 well we're not going to let that happen that agency has already recovered $ ion for consumers who have been taken advantage of by corporations and the behavior of wells fargo shows clearly that we have got to keep the pressure on these big banks so they can never wreck the economy again the way they did back in   i have said we are never going to let wall street wreck main street again and i mean it contrast that  contrast that with my opponent he wants to do away with the rules that have been imposed on wall street he basically wants to let wall street the banks the hedge funds all these other institutions basically do whatever they want again i tell you what we are not going to let that happen we need more rules not fewer rules on them  i want us to make it easier to start a small business to get rid of the red tape to make credit available to make it clear that most new jobs are going to come from small businesses in ama so we should have a big dynamic small business economy but we are not going to let big business and big corporations call the shots anymore that is not wor for us  but 's whole economic vision is really tledown economics it's the e idea that has failed us before you see he believes that all you do is cut taxes on the wealthy and then it tles down well we know that doesn't work we've been down that road and what he wants to do is i think it's fair to say tle down on steroids laughter what he has proposed would slash taxes on the wealthy now i'm a little confused about this because for a long e we've been saying hey where are your tax returns laughter a lot of us wondered what he was hiding because you know if it was something that would make him look good he would put them right out there laughter everybody who has ever run for president in at least the last  years has released their tax returns my husband and i have about  years of tax returns out there you can go and look at them and you can see that you know we paid a lot of taxes and frankly we were grateful we could we are grateful for the blessings that we have had over the last  years  so did any of you see the debate last monday  well you know i raised it i said well ok what is he hiding maybe he's not as rich as he claims maybe he is not as charitable as he claims maybe he doesn't want us to see that he owes hundreds of millions of dollars to foreign banks and foreign lenders or maybe he hasn't paid any taxes now shortly after the debate it was discovered that indeed back in the s he apparently lost a ion dollars on bad investments and failing casinos  ask yourself this who loses money on casinos laughter really  and you know yesterday  yesterday some of his supporters said well it just shows that he's a genius that he didn't pay any taxes laughter well what kind of genius loses a ion dollars in the first place  you know in the debate he said not paying taxes made him smart  but think about what that means it means that all the rest of us who pay our taxes right what's he saying about us but more than that zero taxes means zero for our vets zero for our military zero for pell grants to send young people to college zero for health zero for education and you stop and ask yourself this is the e person who's been going around really just dumping on ama he said our military is a disaster well he could not be more wrong but thank goodness the rest of us pay to support our men and women in uniform who have done so much for us  today in colorado he claims he brilliantly use the laws to avoid paying taxes well that just shows number one he is the poster boy  the poster boy for the e rigged system that he would make even worse just think about it he paid zero at least for about  years we believe now based on what we know and he is advocating for huge tax cuts that would help him and his family even more what does he want us to do pay him to lose money really  but you know
   
 you know there's a lot more to this story and we are just slowly getting it into the public eye so we know he stiffed people didn't pay his s we know he took bankruptcy depending on how you count four or six es you know that he paid no taxes for probably  years we don't know what his taxes would be after that he has always talked about how he can't release his taxes because he is under audit but he admit everything before  is not under audit so  release everything up until  show the aman people your taxes  i'll tell you another thing if i am  if i am fortunate enough to be president we are going to pass a law requiring anybody who is a nominee of a major national party to have to release their taxes  so what did we find out today well a story just came out saying that   used chinese steel and aluminum for two out of the last three construction projects so instead of buying his steel and aluminum from aman plants here in ohio and pennsylvania instead of supporting hardwor families and aman jobs he once again stiffed us he sent that money overseas now he spends a lot of e bashing the chinese right you hear that all the e when he talks well turns out he bought his steel and aluminum from the chinese and it turns out he owes big money to the chinese so this is another one of the episodes of his reality television show where he is saying one thing and doing something else now for years china has been undermining aman businesses and workers by illegally dumping cheap aluminum and steel into our markets you know that right and it sounds like   has been buying that dumped steel and aluminum how can he make ama great again when he won't even buy aman products in our country  and i'll tell you this is personal to me because as a senator i went before the international trade commission on behalf of steelworkers in new york who i represen and as secretary of state i went toe to toe with the chinese i have put forward an agenda to crack down on trade abuses from countries like china to stand up for aman workers and to rebuild aman infrastructure with aman materials like steel and aluminum  and today in toledo i poin out because chrysler just announced an expansion of the plant there for the new jeep wrangler about  more jobs right i poin out when the automobile industry was flat on its back and  workers in ohio could have been absolutely out of a job more than we can even imagine in terms of a longlasting impact on the economy here   said he didn't care save it don't save it didn't matter to him well i'll tell you where i stood i stood in favor of saving the aman automobile industry  and look what we got last year our auto industry had the best year they have had in a really long e and so we have got to keep building it we've got to keep ma sure that there are good jobs and we've got to protect good union jobs against the kind of assault that is coming from all sides  so now i know that ohio is a tough state you've got to get out there and you've got to talk to people answer questions make your case that's what we've been doing that's what we are going to do all the way to the end of this election but i need your help to talk to anybody you know here who thinks they might be voting for   i know you know people i know you do and you've got to stage an intervention  you've got to sit them down and point out how everything he says he wants to do is absolutely opposite of what he has done and how everything he has proposed will help people like him and his family but not the vast majority of families in ohio in fact if you look at his tax proposals they efit him and other wealthy people hedge fund managers and the like and they would actually raise taxes on the middle class families  now that's the kind of contrast we are getting out in the campaign but that's why we need your help to make sure you go out and talk to everybody and you know i know people want change that's part of the aman dynamic spirit we want change but i'll tell you one thing that is certain is we will have change it's just what kind of change it's whether or not we have change that helps the vast majority of amans hardwor amans middleclass families or continues to only help those at the top i want an economy that works for everyone not just those at the top  and that's exactly what we are going to fight for and that is what we are going to get i tell you i've been called a lot of things right i've never been called quitter if i tell you i'm going to get up every day and fight for you that is exactly what i will do  but i know i can't do it  i can't do it alone you know   stood on the stage of his convention and just once again pain this dark and dire picture of ama and he said i alone can fix it he gets confused between leadership and dictatorship  he has a hard e remembering who our friends are and who our adversaries are he has a weird fascination with dictators like   we have a lot of people living in this part of ohio who either themselves or their parents or grandparents came from countries that were under the yoke of oppression and we are never going to let that happen again  and so when  basically signs up for 's wish list that's bad enough but then when he is cavalier  and i'm not tal about basketball  when he is cavalier about nuclear weapons saying that he doesn't care if other countries get them in fact you know if there were nuclear war in east asia japan got nuclear weapons if south korea got nuclear weapons hey you know go at it folks he even said he wouldn't care if saudi arabia got nuclear weapons one thing that has been a bedrock of aman foreign policy through  and  presidents going back to the dawn of the atomic age is we were commit to try and keep other countries from getting access to nuclear weapons to be able to stop proliferation and now it's even more important because it's not only states that we have to worry about like north korea we've got to worry about terrorists getting their hands on nuclear weapons the last thing we want to do is just act like it doesn't matter because it does i was involved in putting together the sanctions against iran that drove them to the negotiating table and what i learned  if you use diplomacy and you're tough about it you can actually get an agreement to put a lid on their nuclear program and we are going to make sure they follow it to the period the comma everything in that agreement i'm going to enforce  and we still have challenges with iran but i think we are in a stronger position given the fact that they are not racing for a nuclear weapon because we have intrusive inspections so i know diplomacy can work because i have done it and i know that  we can defeat isis and the terrorists if we work with other nations if we have a coalition that actually takes them out from the air takes them out on the ground and fights them online where they are doing so much damage by radicalizing and recruiting young people  i've been laying out my plan for what i think it will take to defeat isis and i have no doubt we will and  says he has a secret plan that he won't tell us about well there's no secret he has no plan we've got to do more  we've got to do more to make sure we protect our country we need the best intelligence we can get the best cooperation among law enforcement at all levels of government i will not rest you know as a former senator from new york on / i take this as a personal responsibility i will do everything i can to keep our country safe and to work with others to defeat the threat posed by terrorism  finally my friends we've got to bring our country back together  there is too much divisiveness too much fingerpointing and scapegoating you know our diversity is one of our strengths  we have to listen to each other we don't have to agree that's not required but we need to be respectful we need to listen and then we need to roll up our sleeves and get to work when i was first lady senator secretary of state i worked to find common ground with everybody i worked when i was first lady with s and s to create the children's health insurance program that ensures  million kids  when i was in the senate i worked with practically every  i served with and you know they all have nice things to say about me when i am not running for something  and i will work again to move our country forward and to change the economy so it works better for hardwor people and when i was secretary of state we negotia a treaty with russia to lower nuclear weapons to try to lower the threat of that and we had to get  s and i worked tirelessly and we got them we did that there's a lot we can do if we start listening and respecting each other and avoid the kind of namecalling and insults that we see too much of  so i'm exci about the campaign but i'm even more exci about getting to work for you being able to get up every day and find a way to try to help somebody i mean that is how i was raised in my church and by my family and that is what i have done through my advocacy work and my legal work on behalf of people who needed a voice and i will do everything possible to make sure i deliver results for you and the reason the reason that i have published a book with my great running mate    it's right here  is real simple i want you to know what we say we are going to do because i want you to hold me accountable  i don't believe in bait and switch where i say we are going to do something and then i am really over here doing something else that kind of reminds you somebody doesn't it no here's what we're going to try to do we're going to pay for it by raising taxes on the wealthy and closing loopholes on corporations  and i am the only candidate who ran this whole campaign saying i will never raise taxes on the middle class that is not going to happen when i am president so please join this campaign the last  days talk to your friends remember friends don't let friends vote for   i am motiva every day because now i am a grandmother two beautiful grandchildren and i think about their future i think about their lives i think about our country i want our country to be the land of opportunity the place where dreams do come true if you are willing to work for them not just for my grandchildren but for every child i want every child in this country to have a chance to live up to his or her godgiven potential and if you will help me win this election and then help me work to make it come true we will have a country that delivers on our dreams and a future we can all be proud of thank you and god bless you   presidential candidate delivers remarks at a campaign event in manchester new hampshire (sd/)

 i  i am  i am so so touched and so grateful to be here in manchester with all of you  and particularly with mr khan  as  as he was spea i saw several of you holding up your constitutions  and he reminded us all of the fundamental values that set us apart as amans he and his family exemplify the values that make ama great and in a race that has been marked by ugly suspicion and insults and attacks of all kinds against immigrants and muslims and so many others mr khan i think reminded all of us that we are amans his son was an aman who gave his life for our country we cherish the constitution and we will defend it  in fact when a president is sworn in on inauguration day that's the oath that a new president swears to  to preserve protect and defend the constitution the first words i ever heard from mr khan were about his son's courageous final moments serving our country in iraq he told the other troops in his unit to get back from a suspicious vehicle approaching their position but he went forward he took  steps toward danger before that car exploded after his death he was awarded both the bronze star and the purple heart and here's what mr khan said   that really struck a chord with me and as the story he just told us of the mother telling him about her son being bullied these are words that i would  that all amans and particularly young amans would hear and heed mr khan said we still wonder what made him take those  steps maybe that's the point where all the values all the service to country all the things he learned in this country kicked it it was those values that made him take those ten steps and those ten steps mr khan went on to say told us  meaning he and his wife and his family  told us we did not make a mistake in moving to this country  in fact i think we should all be grateful that this remarkable family decided to make ama their home we should be grateful for everyone who looks at ama and sees a beacon of  worth defending  this means so much  this means so much to me because like all of you i love our country  and i believe with all my heart that our best days are still ahead of us if we reach for them together i also believe as mr khan and were tal before we came on that we will have some work to do to bring about healing and reconciliation after this election we have to begin listening to one another and respecting one another  because our core values are being tes in this election but when i meet people  when i have a chance to hear from them about what they want for themselves and their families my faith in our future has never been stronger this election is a moment of reckoning it is a choice between division or unity between strong steady leadership or a loose cannon who could put everything at risk  and so my friends this is one of these elections that really is a crossroads election in our country i'm grateful to be joined tonight by so many wonderful people there's a big overflow  there are several overflows and i  they can all hear my voice  i want to thank james taylor for that wonderful performance  so many of his songs are a part of the soundtrack for aman and it's wonderful that he could be here with us along with his wife kim  i'm thrilled to be with your next senator maggie hassan  maggie will bring a wealth of experience to washington she will bring the skills that enabled her to work across the aisle in the legislature and with the legislature and we need that kind of common sense problemsolving approach  that independent voice that new hampshire so deserves to have so i  and trust you will send maggie to the senate on tuesday  and i  you will send colin van ostern to the governorship  colin will build on maggie's record of accomplishment and i think about all of the jobs that have been crea in this state how college has been made more affordable how you've taken on the epidemic of addiction you're doing it the new hampshire way and both maggie and colin represent that  i sure think washington needs more of that and i want you also to know how important it is to send congresswoman annie kuster and congresswoman carol shaeporter to washington as well  both annie and carol will bring the e attitude about rolling up their sleeves and getting to work for you that we really need in the congress right now and another great member of the senate who's been up here campaigning for maggie and tal about what will make the senate work better is the senator from rhode island sheldon whitehouse who's here with us  and finally  finally i want to just recognize a new hampshire native who is now the attorney general of massachusetts attorney general maura heeley  now elections are of course a choice  a choice between the people who are running but much more than that they are a choice about what we want to do in our country  what kind of country we want and they are often premised the visions  the views of the candidates and what i've tried to do in this campaign is to lay out an agenda  what a novel idea laughter i actually  i actually want you to know what i will try do if i'm so honored as to become your president  and my  my runningmate   and i got together and we  we put out a book called stronger together which has all of our policies in there it's  yes i see somebody holding it up back there  because we don't only want you to know what we plan to do we want you to hold us accountable when i come back to new hampshire i want you to ask how's that college affordability plan going what are we doing about getting the cost of prescription down how are we managing the economy so that it produces more good jobs for everybody not just those at the top i want  i want us to have an ongoing discussion about how we are all going to contribute to ma our country all it should be i really believe that ama's best years are still ahead of us if we all do our part  and i  i think it's fair to say after all the months of this campaign my opponent has a very dark and divisive view of our country somees when i hear him speak i honestly don't recognize the country that he is tal about somees i'm not sure he recognizes the country he's tal about  did any of you see the debates did you all see the debates  well i did spend fourandahalf hours next to   in those debates proving conclusively i have the stamina to do this inaudible  but
   
 but it's also  but i  i think it's  it's  it's also important that we believe in a ful inclusive bighear uni ama right  where everyone has a place where everyone is included where people who are willing to work hard can get ahead and stay ahead where we recognize the importance of the aman dream and we believe and we will ensure it is big enough for everyone not just a few  so i  i really believe that although my name and my opponent's name may be on the ballot come tuesday what's really on the ballot is what kind of country we want for our children and our grandchildren  what's really on the ballot is every single issue we care about our constitution set up a system of government that has stood the test of e it can somees be frustrating provide challenges  we know that but here we are the longestlasting democracy in the history of the world that is to be cherished and nurtured not demeaned not degraded  now if you believe that our brave men and women in uniform like captain khan deserve a commanderinchief who knows what needs to be done then you have to vote don't leave it to chance don't leave it to others use your voice and your vote because my opponent actually said more countries should have nuclear weapons  and when a journalist asked him about using nuclear weapons he said well why do we make them i wonder if he even realizes he's tal about nuclear war the other day in ohio i was at kent state university and i was introduced by a man named bruce blair he had been in the air force decades ago and he was a launch officer in our nuclear program which meant that he sat in a bunker during his watch e in case the president  whoever the president was  were to order a nuclear attack and bruce blair knows there is no appeal from a president's order to launch a nuclear attack there is no veto by the joint chiefs of staff or anybody else if a president orders a nuclear attack there's about a fourminute window before it happens i had never met mr blair before he's gone on to have a very distinguished career in security studies but as he was watching this campaign and reflecting on the service he did as a young man he realized he could never support   and he called other launch officers  somees called missileers  and asked them what they were thin and to a person they said this is unacceptable this is actually scary so several dozens of them wrote a letter saying that they know what the awesome responsibility is that a president of the uni states holds and they could never support   to be our president and commanderinchief  and if you  if you believe like i do that our economy grows and ama thrives when the middle class grows and thrives then you have to vote too  we're going to make the biggest investment in goodpaying jobs since world war ii  jobs and infrastructure and advanced manufacturing and clean energy small business jobs i want to be the best small business president we've ever had   to enable more people to get star and grow their businesses in contrast my opponent built his fortune on the backs of small business owners but i'm the daughter of a small businessman and i am just so glad my dad never got a contract from    because so many who did were stiffed but i want to make sure that we have easier access to capital less red tape more tax relief for people willing to take the risk of going in to small businesses i also think it's imperative that we make our economy fairer and that means i do support raising the national minimum wage  because as i said i believe in work that's how i was raised and i think we can do better for people who work fulle and still are mired in poverty we want to get back to having ladders of opportunity if you work in ama you ought to be able to get ahead in ama and we're going to make that happen again  and we've got to start recognizing that families need more support and that's why i want to make child care affordable instead of costing as much as tuition  and it is e that we had paid family leave so that you can take care of the most important obligations that you have  and it is way past e to guarantee equal pay for women's work  and you know this is not just a woman's issue this is a family issue if you have a mother a wife sister or daughter this is your issue and this is an issue worth voting on because it's e we made it fair for wor women  and if you believe all of our kids should have the chance to thrive in good schools with good teachers no matter what zip code they live in then you have to vote because we've got to make public education work for everyone  and i think we need some water yes  do we have some water that we can get here if we  if we have some water that would be a big help okay great now look i  i think when it comes to education we do need to have highquality affordable prekindergarten in every community i also believe we need to bring back technical and vocational education into our high schools  because a fouryear college degree should not be the only path to a good job and a middleclass life in new hampshire or in ama  and for anyone who does want to go to college we are going to make it affordable  now after the primary was over  and i have to say you all cleaned my clock in the primary i know laughter but it was a great primary because it was about ideas and issues not insults and i'm proud of the race that senator  and i ran  and  and when it was over  when it was over we got together and we sat down and we said how can we work to deal with a lot of the issues that we were both concerned about in the primary and we've put together a plan  public colleges and universities should be tuition free for everyone who makes less than $ a year  and it should be debtfree for everyone else we have to treat it like an investment  and  and i were just in north carolina campaigning together and it's so exciting because we know that not only do we have make college affordable we also have to help the millions of amans who are already struggling with student debt to ease that burden get those interest rates down make it so you never have to pay more than you can afford  so you see wor for children and families has been the cause of my life but it's never been more important than it is right now and  and it will be our mission together doing everything we can to help all our kids and every aman have the chance to live up to their godgiven potential i am ta very seriously the obligation that i feel to reach out to all amans i'm as for the support not just of s but also s and independents in this election  i want to be the president for all amans  those who vote for me and those who do not vote for me because we have to heal this country and that's going to take everyone  we have to remember how to disagree without being so disagreeable  and you know it is unusual for somebody running for president to say that what we need more of in our country is love and kindness but we really do  toward one another toward people different from ourselves  we all have a role in building a better stronger fairer ama and i am very honored to have gotten the kind of support i have received from s here in new hampshire and i really am very grateful for the recent statement by former senator gordon humphrey about what's at stake in this election  so  you know we can't do any of this work unless we're successful on tuesday it really all starts then our future is in our hands and anyone who says they're going to stay on the sidelines or it doesn't matter really doesn't understand what's at stake in this election we've got to get every aman eligible to vote registered to vote and here in new hampshire you've got e day registration so you can all get out and vote  we've got to get everyone to believe that this election is about you it is about you  your dreams your aspirations your s your family your community i have never felt more strongly about what we can do together i am confident and i am opistic about the future we can make together if you don't know where you're supposed to vote you can go to iwillvotecom they will tell you there you can still volunteer we have been knoc on hundreds of thousands of doors i bet some of yours right and some of you did the knoc  but we are  we are not ta anyone or anything or anyplace for gran so if you want to volunteer you can go to com or text join  it really comes down as far as i'm concerned for me personally to my grandchildren because i feel very blessed that i have had opportunities in our country because of my family and because of what others had done to prepare the path for me going back to our founding and i really want each and every one of us to think for a moment about how we would feel on november th if we were not successful when your kids and grandkids ask you what you did in  when everything was on the line i  you're able to say you vo  you vo for a better stronger fairer ama  an ama where we build bridges not walls  an ama where we prove once and for all that love s hate let's go vote new hampshire thank you god bless you   presidential candidate delivers remarks at a campaign event in philadelphia pennsylvania (sd/)

 hello philadelphia 
   
 oh thank you i am so grateful to be here tonight to spend this e with all of you here in this historic spot and to all the volunteers the activists the union organizers of the hard hats i see in the audience tonight   thank you for coming out for one last rally before election day tomorrow  and personally i am so happy to be finishing this campaign with my husband and my daughter by my side we've been traveling across the country separately trying to cover as much ground as possible and talk to as many voters as we can but i'm really glad that we're all together tonight in philadelphia with you  and how great was it to have jon bon jovi and bruce springsteen with us  but in addition to all of that what is so special for me is that we have our amazing president and first lady with us because for now nearly eight years they have served our nation with grace strength brilliance and a whole lot of cool  and they have shown us again and again as  said right here in philadelphia back at our convention when others go low we go high
 we go high 
 i'm pretty sure as they said tonight that the best way to thank them is to do something really important tomorrow to vote every single one of you and every person you know because as the president just poin out there is a clear choice in this election a choice between division or unity between an economy that works for everyone or only those at the top between strong steady leadership or a loose cannon who could put everything at risk so make no mistakes our core values are being tes in this election we know enough about my opponent we know who he is the real question for us is what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we want to build for our children i'm proud that i had the chance to serve in president 's cabinet  and i am proud that i could watch the extraordinary service of our first lady and one thing i know is that like them i love ama and i know you do too  we love this country we love what it stands for not that we are blind to its flaws its problems its challenges but i believe with all my heart that ama's best days are still ahead of us   if we reach for them together we choose to believe in a ful inclusive bighear ama an ama where everyone has a place everyone's included everyone has a chance to live up to their own godgiven potential  there have been so many memorable moments in this election for me and most of them revolve around the people that i've had the privilege of meeting and last night in manchester new hampshire i had the honor to be introduced by khizr khan whose son captain khan was killed serving our country in iraq  just as he did here at our convention mr khan again reminded us of the responsibility we all share to protect and defend our constitution you remember the story of captain khan the son of immigrants himself brought here as a young child who grew up to join the uni states army and on that fateful day with his unit he saw a suspicious car and he moved toward it to try to determine whether it was a danger or not telling his men to stay back the car was rigged the bomb went off and he died protecting his men he was awarded the bronze star and the purple heart and what mr khan said last night is something i want us all to remember he said after the many derogatory and insulting comments that we've heard from   would his son would captain khan have a place in  's ama that's an important question for all of us because we don't want to shrink the vision of this great country we want to keep expanding it so that everyone  everyone  has a place to pursue your dreams your aspirations the future that you want to create for yourselves and everyone else  think about that when you go to the polls tomorrow think about how throughout our history generations of amans just like us have come together to meet the tests of their e and yes as president  said it star right here in philadelphia when representatives from  unruly colonies came together to launch the greatest experiment the world has ever seen our parents and grandparents defended that democracy they built the great aman middle class they marched for civil rights and voting rights for workers' rights and women's rights for lgbt rights and rights for people with disabilities  and tomorrow we face the test of our e what will we vote for not just against what will we decide is on the ballot because although my name and my opponent's name may be on the ballot every issue you care about is on that ballot if you believe that ama thrives when the middle class thrives then you have to vote  if you believe all of our kids should have good schools and good teachers no matter what zip code they live in then you have to vote  if you believe college should be more affordable you have to vote  if you believe we must reform our criminal justice system so everyone has respect for the law and everyone is respec by the law you have to vote  if you believe we need to protect our kids and pass common sense gun safety reforms you have to vote  if you believe we must raise the minimum wage and finally guarantee equal pay for women then you need to vote  now you know every e i say that last part about equal pay for women my opponent accuses me of playing the women's card well you know what i say if that's playing the women's card then deal me in
 deal me in 
 so it is not just my name or  's name on the ballot tomorrow every issue you care about is at stake and that is just the beginning because we have to bridge the divides in our country i regret deeply how angry the tone of the campaign became
 not your fault  
 and by the way did any of you see those debates  well i stood next to   for fourandahalf hours proving conclusively i have the stamina to be president and commanderinchief  but i have to say
   
 i have to say that there were so many really troubling things that my opponent has said but probably the most horrifying was at the end of the last debate after he has insul everyone more than half the population by the way immigrants african amans latinos pows muslims women he then launches an attack on our democracy refusing to say whether or not he would accept the outcome of the election well let's show tomorrow there will be no question about the outcome of this election  but i also want you to know i will be a president for all amans   s s independents not just the people who support me in this election everyone because i believe we all have a role to play in building a better fairer stronger ama building on the progress that we have enjoyed under president   over the last eight years  i am not going to let anybody rip away the progress we've made and turn the clock back sending us back in e where people are free to question the foundation of our country what our founders here did you know they did not agree on everything in case you haven't remembered there were lots of contentious arguments but they saw a higher purpose and they came together that's what i want us to do and we can take the first step tomorrow please make a plan to vote pennsylvania it all happens tomorrow  if you text the word plan plan to  we will walk you through where to vote when to vote how to get there you can do that right now and please tell your friends your family your neighbors and you can go to iwillvotecom and get all the information you need every person who lives in philadelphia lives within five blocks of your polling place that's it just five blocks and the polls open at  am and they close at  pm and remember if you're in line at  pm they have to let you vote  and so we need your help in these last hours we need your help knoc on doors and ma phone calls helping to turn people out maybe helping people who need assistance to get to the polls you can still volunteer by going to com because none of us  none of us  want to wake up on wednesday morning and wish we had done more years from today when your kids and grandkids ask what you did in  when everything was on the line i want you to be able to say that you did vote you vo for an inclusive bighear openminded country future that will make sure that we all keep moving together because i do believe we are stronger together  and you vo for an ama where we build bridges not walls  and maybe most importantly you vo in great numbers to demonstrate conclusively once and for all that yes love s hate let's get out and vote philadelphia tomorrow  let's make history together thank you and god bless you   presidential candidate delivers remarks at a campaign event in reno nevada (sd)

 thank you thank you so much i  i am so thrilled to be back in reno thank you i  i have to say though i know when i'm here in reno i'm the other  and i am more than ok with that because i think your mayor is doing a terrific job and the fact that she herself is a small businesswoman and commit to really lifting up reno and giving everybody in this great city the biggest little city with a big heart a chance to get ahead and stay ahead i could not be more honored than to have her support and endorsement in this race so thank you so much mayor schieve and let me also thank dr karen hilgersom and everybody here at truckee meadows community college i love community colleges and i know something about what this college is doing to give people of all ages  not just young people  a real chance to get the skills and opportunities that everybody in ama deserves so thank you now i have to i have to begin by saying my original plan for this visit was to focus on our agenda to help small businesses and entrepreneurs this week we proposed new steps to cut red tape and taxes to make it easier for small businesses to get the credit they need to grow and hire i want to be a small business president my father was a small businessman and i believe that in ama if you can dream it you should be able to build it and so we'll be tal a lot more about small business and about our economic plans in the days and weeks ahead but today here in this community college devo to opening minds and creating a great understanding of the world in which we live i want to address something that i am hearing about from amans all over our country everywhere i go people tell me how concerned they are by the divisive rhetoric coming from my opponent in this election and i i understand that concern because it's like nothing we've heard before from a nominee for president of the uni states from one of our two major parties from the start   has built his campaign on prejudice and paranoia he is ta hate groups mainstream and helping a radical fringe take over the  party his disregard for the values that make our country great is profoundly dangerous 
 in just this past week under the guise of outreach to africanamans  has stood up in front of largely white audiences and described black communities in such insulting and ignorant terms poverty rejection horrible education no housing no homes no ownership crime at levels nobody has seen right now he said you can walk down the street and get shot those are his words but when i hear them i think to myself how sad   misses so much he doesn't see the success of black leaders in every field the vibrancy of blackowned businesses the strength of the black church he doesn't see   he doesn't see the excellence of historically black colleges and universities or the pride of black parents watching their children thrive he apparently didn't see police chief brown of dallas on television after the murders of five of his officers conducting himself with such dignity he certainly doesn't have any solutions to take on the reality of systemic racism and create more equity and opportunity in communities of color and for every aman it really does take a lot of nerve to ask people he's ignored and mistrea for decades what do you have to lose because the answer is everything now 's lack of knowledge or experience or solutions would be bad enough but what he's doing here is more sinister  is reinforcing harmful stereotypes and offering a dog whistle to his most hateful supporters it's a disturbing preview of what kind of president he'd be and that's what i want to make clear today a man with a long history of racial discrimination who traffics in dark conspiracy theories drawn from the pages of supermarket tabloids and the far dark reaches of the internet should never run our government our command our military  ask yourself if he doesn't respect all amans how can he serve all amans now i  i know that some people still want to give  the efit of the doubt they  that he will eventually reinvent himself that there's a kinder gentler more responsible   waiting in the wings somewhere because after all it is hard to believe anyone let alone a nominee for president could really believe all the things he says but here's the hard truth there is no other   this is it and maya angelou a great aman whom i admired very much she once said when someone shows you who they are believe them the first e well throughout his career and this campaign   has shown us exactly who it who he is and i think we should believe him when he was getting his start in business he was sued by the justice department for refusing to rent apartments to black and latino tenants their applications would be marked with a c c for colored and then rejec three years later the justice department took  back to court because he hadn't changed and the pattern continued through the decades state regulators fined one of 's casinos for repealy removing black dealers from the floor no wonder the turnover rate for his minority employees was way above average and let's not forget that  first gained political prominence leading the charge for the socalled birthers he promo the racist lie that president  is not really an aman citizen part of a sustained effort to delegiize ama's first black president
 and in   launched his own campaign for president with another racist lie he described mexican immigrants as rapists and criminals and he accused the mexican government of actively sending them across the border none of that is true and oh by the way   by the way mexico's not paying for his wall either laughter if he ever tries to get it built the aman taxpayer will pay for it we'll be stuck with the  but there has been a steady stream of bigotry coming from him i think we all remember when  said a distinguished federal judge born in indiana could not be trus to do his job because quote he's a mexican think about that the man who today is the standard bearer of the  party said a federal judge who by the way had a distinguished record as a us attorney had to go in hiding because mexican drug gangs were after him who has mexican heritage but just like me was born in this country is somehow incapable solely because of his heritage even the  speaker of the house of representatives   described that and i quote as the textbook definition of a racist comment and to this day  to this day  has never apologized to judge curiel but for  that is just par for the course this is someone who retweets white supremacists online like the user who goes by the name white genocide tm  took this fringe bigot with a few dozen followers and spread his message to  million people his campaign famously pos an antisemitic image a star of  imposed over a sea of dollar s that first appeared on white supremacist websites the  campaign has also selec a prominent white national  nationalist leader as a delegate in california and they only dropped him under pressure when asked in a nationally televised interview whether he would disavow the support of  duke a former grand wizard of the ku klux klan  wouldn't do it and only later again under mounting pressure did he backtrack and when  was asked about anti semitic slurs and death threats coming from his supporters he refused to condemn them through it all he has continued pushing discredi conspiracy theories with racist undertones you remember he said that thousands of aman muslims in new jersey cheered the / attacks they didn't he sugges the senator  's father was involved in the kennedy assassination now perhaps in 's mind because mr  was a cuban immigrant he must have had something to do with it and there is absolutely of course no evidence of that just recently  claimed that president  founded isis and he has repea that over and over again his latest paranoid fever dream is about my health and all i can say is  dream on laughter  but  but my friend   laughter  but my friend this is what happens when you treat the national enquirer like gospel they said in october i'd be dead in six months it's also what happens when you listen to the radio host alex jones who claims that / and the oklahoma city bombings were inside jobs
 he even said and this really just is so disgusting he even said the vics of the sandy hook massacre were child actors and no one was actually killed there i don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be to say things like but  doesn't challenge these lies he actually went on jones' show and said your reputation is amazing i will not let you down this from the man who wants to be president of the uni states you know i've stood by president 's side as he made the toughest decisions a commanderinchief has to make in es of crisis our country depends on steady leadership clear thin calm judgment because one wrong move can mean the difference between life and death i know we have veterans here and i know we have families mothers and spouses and children of people currently serving the last thing we need in the situation room is a loose cannon who can't tell the difference  or doesn't care to  between fact and fiction and who buys so easily into racially tinged rumors  someone so detached from reality should never be in charge of ma decisions that are as real as they come and that is yet another reason why   is simply temperamentally unfit to be president of the untied states  now i  i hear and i read some people who are saying well that  his bluster and is bigotry is  is just overhea campaign rhetoric an outrageous person saying outrageous things for attention but look at his policies the ones that  has proposed  they would put prejudice into practice and don't be distrac by his latest efforts to muddy the waters he may have some new people putting new words in his mouth but we know where he stands he would form a deportation force to round up millions of immigrants and kick them out of the country he'd abolish the bed rock constitutional principle that says if you're born in the uni states you're an aman citizen he says that children born to undocumen parents in ama are anchor babies and should be depor millions of them he'd ban muslims around the world from entering our country just because of their religion now think about that for a minute how would that actually work the people landing in us airports would line up to get their passports stamped  just like they do now but in s ama when they step up to the counter the immigration officer would ask every single person what is your religion and then what what is someone says i'm a tian but the agent doesn't believe him do they have to prove it how would they do that really ever since the pilgrims landed on plymouth rock ama has distinguished itself as a haven for people fleeing religious persecution believing in religious freedom and religious liberty  under   ama would distinguish itself as the only country in the world to impose a religious test at the border now come to think of it there actually maybe one other place that does that the so called islamic state the territory that isis controls what a cruel irony that someone running for president would equate us with them now but don't worry some will say as president  will be surrounded by smart advisors who will rein in his worst impulses so when a tweet gets under his skin and he wants to retaliate with a cruise missile maybe cooler heads will convince him not to well maybe but look at who he's put in charge of his campaign
  likes to say he only hires the best people but he's had to fire so many campaign managers it's like an episode from the apprentice  and the latest shake up was designed to quote let  be  so to do that he hired stephen  the head of a right wing website called breitbartcom as the campaign's ceo now to give you a flavor of his work here are a few headlines that they've published and i'm not ma this up birth control makes women unattractive and crazy would you rather your child had feminism or cancer gabby giffords the gun control movement's n shield hoist it high and proud the confederate flag proclaims a glorious heritage and that one came shortly after the charleston massacre when s and s alike were doing everything they could to heal racial divides that breitbart and  tried to inflame just imagine   reading that and thin this is what i need more of in my campaign now  has nasty things to say about pretty much everyone this spring he railed against speaker   for quote rubbing his socialjustice catholicism in my nose every second no wonder he's gone to work for  the only presidential candidate ever to get into a public feud with the pope it's truly hard to believe but according to the southern poverty law center which tracks hate groups breitbart embraces ideas on the extremist fringe of the conservative right this is not conservatism as we have known it this is not ism as we have known it these are racist ideas racebaiting ideas antimuslim anti immigrant antiwoman all key tenants ma up an emerging racist ideology known as the altright now altright is short for alternativeright the wall street journal describes it as a loose but organized movement mostly online that rejects mainstream conservatism promotes nationalism and views immigration and multiculturalism as threats to white identity so the de facto merger between breitbart and the  campaign represents a landmark achievement for this group a fringe element has effectively taken over the  party and this is part of a broader story  the rising tide of hardline rightwing nationalism around the world just yesterday one of britain's most prominent rightwing leaders nigel farage who stoked antiimmigrant senents to win the referendum to have britain leave the european union campaigned with   in mississippi  farage has called for a bar on the children of legal immigrants from public schools and health services he has said women are  and i quote  worth less than men and he supports scrapping laws that prevent employers from discriminating based on race that's who   wants by his side when he is addressing an audience of aman voters and the grandgodfather of this global brand of extreme nationalism is russian president   in fact farage has appeared regularly on russian propaganda programs now he's standing on the e stage as the  nominee  himself heaps praise on  and embraces prorussian policies he talks casually of abandoning our nato allies recognizing russia's annexation of crimea giving the kremlin a free hand in eastern europe aman presidents from truman to reagan to  to  to  have rejec the kind of approach  is ta on russia and we should too
 all of this adds up to something we've never seen before of course there's always been a paranoid fringe in our politics a lot of it arising racial resentment but it's never had the nominee of a major party sto it encouraging it and giving it a national megaphone until now on  duke's radio show the other day the mood was jubilant we appear to have taken over the  party one white supremacist said duke laughed no there's still more work to do he replied so no one should have any illusions about what's really going on here the names may have changed racists now call themselves racialists white supremacists now call themselves white nationalists the paranoid fringe now calls itself altright but the hate burns just as bright now  is trying to rebrand himself as well but don't be fooled there's an old mexican proverb that says tell me with whom you walk and i will tell you who you are so we know who  is  a few words on a teleprompter won't change that he says he wants to make ama great again but more and more it seems as though his real message seems to be make ama hate again and this isn't just about one election it's about who we are as a nation it's about the kind of example we want to set for our children and our grandchildren next e you see  on tv think about all the children listening across ama kids hear a lot more than we think parents and teachers are already worrying about what they call the  effect they report that bullying and harassment are on the rise in our schools especially targeting students of color muslims and immigrants at a recent high school basketball game in indiana white students held up  signs and taun latino players on the opposing team with chants of build the wall and speak english after a similar incident in iowa one frustra school principal said they see it in a presidential campaign and now it's ok for everyone to say this we wouldn't tolerate this kind of behavior before and we wouldn't tolerate it in our homes and we should not stand for it from a presidential candidate  my friends this is a moment of reckoning for every  dismayed that the party of  has become the party of  it's a moment of reckoning for all of us who love our country and believe that ama is better than this twenty years ago when bob dole accep the  nomination he poin to the exits in the convention hall and told any racist in the party to get out the week after /  w  went to a mosque and declared for everyone to hear that muslims love ama just as much as i do in   mccain told his own supporters that they were wrong about the man he was trying to defeat senator mccain made sure they knew barrack  he said was an aman citizen and a decent person we need that kind of leadership again  we can have our disagreements and believe me i understand that i think that's healthy we need good debates but we need to do it in a respectful way not fingerpointing and blaming and stirring up this bigotry and prejudice every day more amans are standing up and saying enough is enough including s and i am honored to have their support in this campaign  and i promise you this with your help i will be a president for s s and independents for those who vote for me and for those who vote against me i will be a president for all amans
 because i truly believe we are stronger together and this is a vision for the future roo in our values and reflec in a rising generation of young people the young people in ama today are the most open diverse and connec generation we have ever seen  how many of you saw any of the olympics right  i was  i was so proud i always get carried away every e the olympics are on and you look at the diversity of our athletes look at our fabulous olympic team representing the uni states of ama  ibtihaj muhammad an african aman muslim from new jersey won the bronze medal in fencing with grace and skill  would she even have a place in  's ama and i'll tell you when i was growing up in so many parts of our country simone manuel and katie ledecky would not have been allowed to swim in the e public pool and now together on our swimming team they're winning olympic medals as teammates  i don't know about you but i don't think we have a person to waste we want to build an ama where everyone has a place where if you work hard and you do your part you can get ahead and stay ahead that's a basic bargain of ama and we cannot get to where we need to be unless we move forward together and stand up against prejudice and paranoia and prove again that ama is great because ama is good thank you all so very much let's go out and win the election god bless you and god bless the uni states of ama rodham   presidential candidate delivers remarks at the national baptist convention th annual session

 good evening this is the day the lord has made let us rejoice and be glad in it  president young pastors friends i'm very grateful for this great chance to be with you during your week of convention i'm especially pleased to see my friend the mayor of this great city he is someone who  if you haven't gotten to know i  you do  thank you mayor sly james i was also   deligh to greet on the way in the new jackson county executive major league baseball star and all around good guy frank white who has done such an incredible amount of good work on the field and now off the field i want to thank all of you dr miles dr brown all our friends from this city and this state for hosting us i want to acknowledge on a personal point dr shaw celebrating  years as pastor of the white rock baptist church  when i saw him tonight i kidded him and said he star when he was two laughter i'm sure there's a law against that dr shaw dr mckinney dr brown all the members of the executive board and state presidents now i know that reverend jackson was with you on monday and congressman cleaver was with you on tuesday so talk about two tough acts to follow but they are both dear longstanding friends of mine and i'm honored to be on this e stage as so many distinguished leaders now i happen to be a born and raised methodist but i've been married to a southern baptist for more than  years  and from arkansas to new york  friends of arkansas  we've got friends from arkansas here but across this great country you've welcomed me into your congregations with open arms and open hearts and i am grateful for the friendship support and tian hospitality i have found there as pastors as spouses of pastors families of pastors you know better than anyone the importance of building relationships of trust and respect and i am sure some of you are sick and tired of politicians who think they can just show up at election e say a few nice words and then earn your support right well you and your congregations deserve better than that you deserve a sustained commitment to expanding opportunity equity and justice not just for two or four years not just when the cameras are on and people are watching but every single day and you know better than anyone that people who look at the africanaman community and see only poverty crime and despair are missing so much  they're missing the vibrancy of black owned businesses the excellence of historically black colleges and universities  they're missing the success of black leaders in every field and the passion of a new generation of young black activists and yes they are missing the strength of the black church the solid rock on which so much is built  well i see you i see the work you do and the lives you change and today i want to say something that you don't hear often enough thank you thank you  thank you for answering the charge given to us by jesus as matthew records defeed the hungry clothe the naked visit the sick welcome the stranger thank you for loving all people especially the least the last and the lost among us and you know so well we're not asked to love each other not urged or reques we are commanded to love  in deed jesus made it his greatest commandment when i used to teach the occasional sunday school class i often taught on that lesson that's a hard commandment to obey some days it's really hard for me laughter but in so many ways all of you have answered that call i've been privileged to see your love in action with my own eyes i've seen the love at mount zion missionary baptist church in cedar rapids iowa pastor damien epps and his congregation collec tens of thousands of water bottles to send to families in flint michigan suffering from water poisoned with lead  because they remembered that eight years before when the mississippi rose up and flooded eastern iowa others came to there aid as pastor epps said they are fellow amans they are n beings we should want to reach out and help and he's right that ethic is at the core of our tian faith and we all have work together to make sure every child in ama has clean water to drink clean air to breathe and good schools no matter what zip code they live in i've seen the love at tabernacle community baptist church in milwaukee reverend don darius butler has helped organize gun buy back programs because none of us can sit back while the epidemic of gun violence ravages our communities and our country it is as you know by the far the leading cause of death for young black men more than the next nine causes of death combined and i promise you this as president i'll stand with you in the fight for commonsense gun safety reforms  i've seen the love at the triumph baptist church in philadelphia where reverend james hall guided by what he calls the three e's of evangelism education and economic development has been led to set up a credit union to help people in the community overlooked or ignored by the banks so they can get a small business loan save for college or put something away for retirement they've helped build a supermarket in a neighborhood that hadn't seen one in more than  years and they're reaching out beyond the pews to help families live healthy prosperous lives i've seen the love at dexter avenue  memorial baptist church in montgomery alabama it was an honor to join reverend cromwell handy and his congregation last december to celebrate the th anniversary of rosa parks' courageous action against segregation  and by the way   rosa parks may have opened up every seat on the bus now it's our job to create good jobs so everyone can afford the fare and they can actually get bus routes to reach every neighborhood that connects them with safe affordable housing and good jobs as president i will be your partner in this work of translating love into action together we'll make transformative investments in communities that have been left out and left behind for far too long from our neglec inner cities to struggling rural communities we'll work with both parties to make the biggest investment in good new jobs since world war ii including $ ion to tackle the challenge of youth unemployment which is twice as high for young africanamans as it is for young white amans  we'll ban the box and do more to help people who've paid their debt to society find jobs and housing when they get out  and we will embrace congressman  clyburn's    plan steering  percent of federal investments to neighborhoods where  percent of the population has been living below the poverty line for  years  that's a great idea whose e has come and we can translate it into reality together we'll face head on systemic racism and work to reform our criminal justice system from end to end because everyone in every community should have respect for the law and be respec by the law  we'll beat back the assault on voting rights it is a blast from the  crow past that must be stopped  we should be expanding voting rights instead the best way to stand up to those who are trying to prevent any person from exercising his or her vote is to register and show up and vote against them and make sure your vote counts loudly and clearly  there's so much we can do if we keep love in our hearts as we do the nobel work of brea down barriers that hold amans back now as you well know we are in the final stretch of the election that may be the most consequential of our lifees an election in which all of these issues and so many more are at stake our nation's values are being questioned in this election we are facing a candidate with a long history of racial discrimination in his business  who traffics in toxic conspiracy theories like the lie that president  is not a true aman  if he doesn't even respect all amans how can he serve all amans  so we must keep calling him out and rejecting the hateful bigo rhetoric that seeks to pit amans one against each other and continue ma the case in every way for our vision of an ama that is stronger together an ama where all our children have the choice to live up to their god given potential no matter where they come from or what they look like or what the circumstances of their lives have been i have laid out my vision and my agenda in fact senator  and i have just published a book called stronger together that lays it out clearly so you know what you're voting for not just against  and we're going to get the economy to work for everyone not just those at the top how we're going to have more jobs and infrastructure advanced manufacturing clean renewable energy how we're going to do more to help small businesses the fastest growing segment of small business in ama today our small businesses star by africanaman women  i want to be a small business president to help everyone willing to take the chance and we're going to make the economy fairer we are going to raise the national minimum wage noone who works full e should be mired in poverty at the end of a long hard year  and yes we are finally going to guarantee equal pay for women's work so that we raise family incomes and provide the respect that comes from being paid what you are entitled to earn and we're going to make education work for every child early childhood education universal prekindergarten i want to bring technical education back into high school it was a mistake when we took all that vocational education out of our high schools  i want every young person who wants to go to college to be able to go to college but i want every young person who wants to do a good day's work in a job that builds ama the machinist the tool and dye makers the computer coders i want them to feel they are just as welcome and wan and we're going to make college affordable for everybody and i have a $ ion plan specifically focused on historically black colleges and universities that serve our nation and provide the leaders of the next generation  and we're going to help you pay down your student debt  it is way past e and let's make sure health care is available affordable of high quality for everybody and we've got to get the cost of prescription drugs down  and we have to do more to help with mental health and addiction two problems i hear about across our country which i know you hear about in your churches so we have a lot of work to do and we're going to keep wor to earn every vote and never take any community or any person for gran   and i have launched a nationwide drive to register and commit  million amans to vote by election day and i  you will be part of it  this election is too important for anyone to sit on the sidelines today for a few minutes i want to leave aside the politics and do something that doesn't always come naturally to a mid western methodist laughter that is to talk about my own faith how it lead me to a life of service how it will guide me as president somees people ask me are you a praying person and i tell them if i wasn't one before laughter  one week living in the white house or on the campaign trail would have turned me into a praying person but i had the great blessing to be raised by a family in a church that instilled in me a deep and abiding tian faith and practice i still remember my late father a gruff former navy man on his knees praying by his bed every night that made a big impression on me as a young girl seeing him humble himself before god my mother taught sunday school at our church partly she said because she wan to make sure my brothers actually showed up at sunday school when they walked out the door her faith was roo in gratitude for the love that helped her survive a painful childhood after her own family abandoned and mistrea her she was sustained by the kindness of others like the first grade teacher who saw she had nothing to eat at lunch and brought extra food to share my mother was determined to pay that kindness forward and she really liked the wesley and credo of our church  do all the good you can for all the people you can in all the ways you can as long as ever you can i was also so blessed to have a remarkable youth minister who believed like  wesley the founder of methodism that the world is my parish he told us these young white kids in a suburban area of chicago you can't just be satisfied in your own church and your own middle class life we're going into the inner city of chicago we're going into church basements for fellowship with young people your age from africanaman churches and hispanic churches that was the first e i was in a black church when i was a teenager he took us to hear dr  luther   speak  he sent home the permission slips  whether we could get in the church van to go into chicago on a sunday night to hear dr  and some of the parents wouldn't let their kids go my mother said this is a historic opportunity i remember  i remember hearing dr  preach one of those wellknown sermons staying awake during the revolution and then i stood in line with everybody in that big hall just to shake his hand and look into his eye his words the power of his example affec me deeply and added to the lessons of my minister to face the world as it is not as we might want it to be but to commit ourselves to turning it into what it should be so thanks to my family and my church i am braced in activist social justice faith the roll up your sleeves and get your hands dirty faith as st francis of assisi reporly advised try to preach the gospel always and if necessary use words  the scripture tells us that faith without words is dead the epistle of james tells us we cannot just be hearers of the word we must be doers and i believe that with all my heart i am grateful for the gift of personal salvation and for the great obligation of the social gospel  to use the gift of grace wisely to reflect the love of god and follow the example of jesus t to the greater good of god's beloved community that's what lead me to devote my life in the ways i could to serving others especially children i went to work right out of law school for the great marian wright edelman the daughter of a baptist minister from nettsville south carolina and the founder of the children's defense fund  she sent me door to door in new bedford massachusetts on behalf of children with disabilities who weren't able at that e to attend public schools to south carolina to investigate the plight of  and  year old boys imprisoned alongside grown men who had commit serious felonies and to alabama to expose the racism of segrega academies  i went undercover to alabama all by myself mary just said well you just have to go do it and i did now it would have been easier and certainly more remunerative to follow many of my law school classmates to a high powered new york law firm but the call to service roo in my faith was just too powerful for me it has always been about trying to live up to the responsibility described by the prophet micah that we do justice love kindness and walk humbly with our god  humility is not something you hear much about in politics is it
 no
 but we should none of us is perfect st  reminds us we all see through a glass darkly and for now only know in part it's because of that because of the limitations we all face that faith requires a leap the conviction of things unseen it's because of our limitations and imperfections that we must reach out beyond ourselves to god and to each other it isn't easy but i've learned to be grateful not just for my blessings but also for my faults and there are plenty i've made my share of mistakes i don't know anyone who hasn't everyone here today has stumbled on their own stony paths its grace that lifts us up and grace that leads us home  but it's also our job to learn from our mistakes to do all we can to do better next e and to stay grateful to live by the discipline of gratitude our tian faith is a journey that never ends it's a constant challenge to live up to our own s and ideals to love and to forgive others as we want to be loved and forgiven ourselves you know as president  reminded us see high office is by definition an act of audacity and yet our greatest leaders are often the most humble because they recognize both the awesome responsibilities of power and the frailties of n action i've sat in the situation room with president  weighing conflicting advice and imperfect information wrestling with the hardest choices a leader can make whether to send our young men and women into harm's way knowing that some of them will never return there is nothing more humbling than that nothing that should drive you to your knees more than that that's why in this e of both peril and promise we need a president who understands that none of us has all the answers and no one person can fix our problems alone  a president who understands we have to look out for each other and lift each other up not tear each other down that's what we need to do together invest in our people believe in each other create the jobs and the schools and the opportunities for young people so that they believe that we care about them send our children to schools that reflect their promise not our neglect make sure every child is given the health care he or she needs whether it is for an ailment of the body or the mind stand ready to lift each other up when we fall as we will give those who have made mistakes a second third chance our faith is a faith of second and third and fourth and fifth chances for those who genuinely are see redemption  and we need a president who understands the powerful role that faith and communities of faith have always played in moving our country toward justice from the abolitionists of the th century to the civil rights movement of the th century to the unfinished business of today a president who will pray with you and for you  who will defend the dignity of every individual and the principal of religious freedom that was woven into the moral fabric of our nation from the very beginning yes we need a president who will do justice love kindness and walk humbly with our god my friends one of the greatest privileges of this campaign has been getting to know a remarkable group of women who've lost children to gun violence or police incidents they're known as the mothers of the movement and their hearts may be broken but their souls shine through i'll never forget listening to gwen carr the mother of  garner describe the mission these mothers feel called to lead we were at the central baptist church in columbia south carolina pastored by reverend y ray ezell senior i wish you all could have heard her gwen was as eloquent as any preacher she recalled the pain of losing her son she said at first she couldn't even get out of bed but then she said the lord talked to me and told me are you going to lay here and die like your son or are you going to get up and uplift his name she realized in that moment that none of us can rest as long as there are others out there to be saved and that her voice could move people to action and then she said this i had to turn my sorrow into a strategy my morning into a movement gwen hasn't stopped wor since bringing more and more allies to the cause of peace and justice because she knows in a way that tragedy and profound loss can teach us that we are stronger together than we could ever be alone gwen and the other mothers of the movement are living what the scripture tells us let us not grow weary in doing good for in due season we shall reap if we do not lose heart  these are words we all should live by and if i have the great honor of serving as your president these are words that i will lead by thank you all and may god bless you and may god bless our great country thank you  delivers remarks at the national association of black journalists and the national association of hispanic journalists' joint convention (sd)

 good morning i am so pleased to be here i want to thank you all for the invitation for the introduction to everyone associa with nabj and nahj i want to just mark the moment because you we're crea in this hotel i don't know if there are any original founders but if there are could you all stand up and we could give you some recognition i am deligh to thank you for the important work you do everyday and now more then ever we need you to keep holding leaders and candidates accountable and in the tradition of pathbrea journalists like ethel payne and ru salazar we need you to make sure that ama's front pages and nightly new casts and online information reflects the great diversity of our nation someone that i had the privilege of knowing the late great bob maynard former owner of the oakland tribune once said  and i quote bob it is in seeing ourselves whole that we can begin to see ways of wor out our differences of understanding our similarities and becoming a more cohesive nation and that is what you do everyday helping us to see ourselves as whole  i'm loo forward to our discussion which i'm sure will cover a wide range of issues but i want to take just a few minutes to focus on a challenge that doesn't get enough attention on the campaign trial although i've been trying and that is how do we expand economic opportunity for africanamans and latinos across ama and you know very well  it's been said  that when the economy catches a cold communities of color get pneumonia the great recession hit our whole country hard but the toll was especially difficult for black and latino families black wealth was cut in half for latinos it dropped  percent that represen decades even generations of hard work and during these past  months people across our country have described to me how hard it's been to get back on their feet in an economy that is still not wor the way we all want to see it and barriers of systemic racism makes that even harder now i believe that president  does not get the credit he deserves for leading us out of the great recession  and i like to remind people he had nothing to do with creating it in the first place  he came into office in this worst of all financial crises since the great depression  was handed to him and i think if you fairly look at the record you have to conclude that his leadership saved us from a great depression
 so as bad a things became   million jobs lost  million homes lost $ trillion in family wealth wiped out  as bad as it was there's no telling how far down we would have gone without his leadership so we are out of the ditch that we were in and now we've got to do even more we've got to build on the progress we've made  million new jobs in the last seven and a half years  million people now have health insurance who did not have it before he became president so we've got to have the will and the plans together to move forward that's why i've proposed a comprehensive new commitment to african aman and latino communities to make serious sustained investments to create more good paying jobs to help families build and rebuild wealth to support black and latino owned small businesses for me these aren't just economic issues they're part of a long continuing struggle for civil rights rosa parks opened up every seat on the bus now we've got to expand economic opportunities so everyone can afford the fare and we have to make sure the bus route reaches every neighborhood and connects families with safe affordable housing and good jobs  sylvia mendez and ruby bridges helped desegregate our schools now we've got to help every family afford the books computers and internet access that our kids need to learn in the st century and so in my first  days as president we will work with both parties to pass the biggest investment in new good paying jobs since world war ii that includes jobs in manufacturing clean energy technology and innovation small businesses and infrastructure if we invest in infrastructure now we will not only create jobs today we will lay the foundation for the jobs of the future we're going to also focus on creating jobs and communities where unemployment remains stubbornly high after generations of underinvestment and neglect i'm a big fan of congressman  clyburn's  plan steering  percent of federal investment to neighborhoods where  percent of the population has been living below the poverty line for  years we need that kind of focused targe investment in urban places rural places wherever amans have been left out and left behind we're also going to invest $ ion in creating jobs for young people there's a big gap here the unemployment rate among latino and african aman youth is significantly higher than for whites you know it's hard to write a resume if you have nothing to put on it we're going to help our young people get that first job so they can get that second job so they can build a good solid middle class life that will give them and their families a better future we're also going to do more to help black and latino entrepreneurs get access to capital so they have a real chance at turning their ideas into thriving businesses now i think that's not only good for those entrepreneurs it's good for their families their workers and their communities additionally as part of our end to end reform of the criminal justice system we're going to help people succeed when they return home from jail or prison we're going to ban the box so they can be judged by their skills and talents not by their pasts and we will dedicate $ ion to provide training and support to returning citizens so they can get a good paying job and in my first  days i'm going to introduce legislation for comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship  that's not only the right thing to do every independent analysis shows it will add hundreds of ions of dollars to our economy it will also keep families together we need to bring hard wor people out of the shadows ama has always been a place where people from around the world work hard and apply their talents to aman growth and innovation in pursuit of their own dreams so we're going to do everything we can to get this done
 we need to build an economy and a future that every aman can be proud of and be a part of an economy that works for everyone not just those at the top that will be my mission as president these are just some of the highlights of our plan i  you will go to my website com to read the details including how we are going to pay for everything i have proposed and of course i  you will compare what i'm proposing to what my opponent is tal about now here's one measure that you could use for that comparison an independent economist recently calcula that if my agenda for jobs and growth is put into place our economy would create at least  million jobs within four years we actually think it could be more than that now this economist also ran the numbers on   including his disastrous and inne plan to round up and deport millions of hard wor immigrants the result according to mark zandi who was the economic advisor to  mccain during his  run for the presidency the result of 's plans would be a lengthy recession with  million jobs lost now of course  's problems go far beyond economics at every turn he stokes division and resentment he says horrible things about one group of amans after another he's hearkening back to the most shameful chapters of our history and appealing to the ugliest impulses of our society you know the list you've repor on it he star this campaign by describing mexican immigrants as criminals and rapists he retweets white nationalists he says a distinguished federal judge can't be trus because he is of mexican heritage he talks about banning muslims from coming to the uni states a land built on religious freedom and yes he also talks about curtailing press freedom as well we need to stand up as a country and say that   doesn't represent who we are and what we believe that is what my campaign what   and i and everyone supporting us is doing everyday and we're going to keep at it because i believe with all my heart that ama is better than this ama is better than   we just launched an all spanish twitter account because we want to bring as many amans as possible into this conversation we've opened offices in every state because we want to compete everywhere we want to bring our message and our vision to all corners of our country but we can't do it alone everyone   and independent needs to stand up and speak out now i think journalists have a special responsibility to our democracy in a e like this as ida b wells once said people must know before they can act and there is no educator to compare to the press now many of you are showing the way it's a badge of honor when jorge ramos gets thrown out of a press conference for challenging    or when another news organization gets banned for reporting what he says as jorge said the best journalism happens when you take a stand when you denounce injustice so i  you'll keep calling it like you see it keeping holding all of us accountable you know i have laid out all these plans and i'm well aware that i have been somees made fun of for putting out these plans about the economy and education and criminal justice reform and healthcare and gun safety measures and all the rest of it but i do have this old fashioned idea when you run for president you ought to tell the voters of ama what you would do as president so i am going to keep telling you what i would do because i want you to hold me accountable press and citizen alike because the stakes are as high as they've ever been in our lifees and we all have to do our part so thank you for what you do everyday thank you for inviting me to address you today and i look forward to ta some of your questions thank you all very much
 please welcome moderators kristen welker white house correspondent for nbc news and lori montenegro national correspondent for telemundo 
welker thank you i really appreciate it good afternoon to all of you what an honor to be here and it's fantastic to see so many people gathered here for this great conversation we're going to have with secretary  secretary  thank you for being here today we really appreciate it usually i am on the campaign trail with secretary  and we're at a very crowded event so it's great to be able to have this conversation this afternoon
montenegro madam secretary thank you so much for accompanying us you know so many questions so little e so i think we should just get right to it
 great
montenegro you alluded to the topic that i want to ask you about latinos are very much concerned about the economy they are concerned about education they also believe in trustworthiness i want to start with a topic that i believe will result could you know tell the future of it after this election  it's immigration reform many latinos are discouraged by the lack of immigration reform they believe their vote has been taken for gran we know what your position is but what i would like for you to do is to walk us through the steps
 right
montenegro how will you get immigration reform something that president  was not able to do so that latinos can believe that something is going to happen that their vote again is not being taken for gran considering that the house at least the house will remain under  control
 it's a great question and it's one that i obviously have given much thought to because i am determined that we are going to achieve comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship so here is how i see it  first of all we are going to start immediately i want this to be a clear high priority for my administration we will be prepared to introduce legislation as quickly as we can do so i am hoping that the outcome of the election which i am wor hard to ensure a victory will send a clear message to our  friends that it's e for them to quit standing in the way of immigration reform if you remember after the  election the  national comee did what they called an autopsy of their loss and concluded that they could not continue to deny the importance of immigration reform and they urged s running for office to get on board now that hasn't turned out the way that they seemed to have d we have instead a  nominee who has been virulently anti immigrant but there's nothing like winning to change minds and i think number one we have a good chance of having a  senate if everybody does what i  they will do and vote for  candidates for the senate i believe we will pick up some seats in the house and at least if not take it back narrow the numbers if we move in the senate and then we demand that there be a vote in the house because i am convinced that if the bipartisan  that had been achieved in the senate  remember when   was for it and people worked hard and achieved it if it had been allowed to come for a vote in the house it would have passed so i view the political landscape as increasingly favorable to us ma this happen i will also defend the president's executive actions i like you was disappoin with the supreme court decision but remember what it did it sent the case back to be tried it did not determine the case so daca and dapa are still alive  has said one of his first acts as president would be to eliminate every executive order that president  has signed including those on immigration issues so i will defend daca and dapa while i work vigorously for immigration reform
 i have proposed an office of immigrant affairs for the white house so that we are able to answer questions and provide information and help people i will take a very hard look at the deportation priorities my priority are violent criminals people suspec of any kind of connection to terrorism not hard wor mothers and fathers and people who go to work help support this economy pay $ ion a year into social security so we will take a hard look at that we will close private detention centers just like i want to end private prisons we're going to close private detention centers so i have a very active agenda and we're going to be moving on it and i believe  and you know obviously it depends upon the outcome of this election  which is why it's so important to register more voters my campaign is trying to register  million more voters convince people to turn out because we're going to start early and we're going to be tenacious and absolutely commit to getting a positive result i think the chances once we win will improve dramatically
montenegro madam secretary you spoke about the deportations president  some call the deporterinchief you have alluded already to your priority will be criminals but how do you walk balk the deportations they're people who are not criminals that are depor daily from this country how do you walk back the deportations comply with the law and not inherit the title of deporterinchief and at the e e all these steps to help mobilize the latino community to the polls many who still believe that their vote is taken for gran in  and  and then we have the emails from wikileaks that say that are the loyalty brand of the party
 well look i think that the president was commit to immigration reform it's one of the reasons we got the bipartisan  passed in the senate and what we didn't get though was enough political pressure to turn that  into a voting issue in the  midterm election and here's one of my frustrations people turn out to vote for presidential elections and then often don't for midterm elections so we lost  we lost a lot of the leverage because we lost the house of representatives so nothing happens easily or quickly in modern politics in ama but here is what i know as i have said we are not going to be deporting hard wor people and breakup families i've been on record for a yearanda half about this and that will be how i direct the department of homeland security to act we are going to push on immigration reform and i will need not only a considerable vote in november but i will need people across our country to make it clear to their elec representatives that they're going to be held accountable for how they are going to act on immigration reform we put enough organizing and political effort into this i am opistic and i believe we can get this done but it won't happen simply because we want it and i can only say that i will give you my very best efforts and i will do everything i can to help elect a  senate i've already talked to some of my former colleagues in the senate this will be fasttracked we already know what can pass the senate because it happened just a few years ago and if we then put enough pressure on the house and do everything we can to really force them to have to take what the senate passes i think the outcome will be very different this e that's my goal and that's what i'm going to do every thing i can to achieve
montenegro thank you madam secretary
welker madam secretary your poll numbers went way up this week and yet the email controversy was still in the headlines so i wan to give you the opportunity to respond this week you told two separate news organizations that fbi director james comey said quote my answers were truthful and that what i said is consistent with what i have told the aman people that assertion as you know has been debunked by multiple news organizations which point out that director comey did say there's no indication that you lied to the fbi but he didn't weighin on whether or not you were truthful to the aman people so my question for you is are you mischaracterizing director comey tesony and is this not undercutting your efforts to rebuild trust with the aman people
 well kristin i appreciate your as that because i was pointing out in both of those instances that the director comey had said that my answers in my fbi interview were truthful that's really the bottom line here and i have said on  during the interview and in many other occasions over the past months that what i told the fbi  which he said was truthful  is consistent with what i have said publicly so i may have short circui it and for that i  you know will try to clarify because i think  you know  wallace and i we're probably tal past each other be  because of course he could only talk to what i had told the fbi and i apprecia that now i have acknowledged repealy that using two email accounts was a mistake i  and i take responsibility for that but i do think you know having him say that my answers to the fbi were truthful and then i should quickly add what i said was consistent with what i had said publicly and  and that's really sort of in my view trying to tie both ends together
welker is the one inconsistently though that you said you never sent or received classified material and he did say there were three emails that were marked classified at the e is that an inconsistency
 well he  here's  here's what  here are the facts behind that as well you know that i preside i  i sent over  emails to the state department that were workrela emails director comey said that only  out of  had anything resembling classified markers what does that mean well usually if any of you have ever served in the government a classified document has a big heading on the top which makes very clear what the classification is and in questioning director comey made the point that the  e mails out of the  did not have the appropriate mars and it was therefore reasonable to conclude that anyone including myself would have not  suspec that they were classified and in fact i think that has been discussed by others who have said two out of those three were later explained by the state department not to have been in any way confidential at the e that they were delivered so that leaves the  out of  emails that director comey testified  contained classified information but again he acknowledged there were no mars on those  emails and so what we have here is pretty much what i have been saying throughout this whole year and  and that is that i never sent or received anything that was marked classified now if in retrospect which is what is behind the  number if in retrospect some different agencies said but it should have been  although it wasn't  it should have been that's what the debate about  is about but director comey said there was absolutely no intention on my part to either ignore or in any way dismiss the importance of those documents because they weren't marked classified so that would have hard to do and i will go back to where i star i regret using one account i've taken responsibility for that but i'm pleased to be able to clarify and explain what i think the bottom line is on this
welker and just very quickly before we get to our panel   says this whole thing means that you can't be trus with national security today you are endorsed by former cia director  morell who says it's  who can't be trus and he went so far as to indicate that that he's been termed  by  do you agree with that assessment
 well i had the great honor of wor with  morell spending a lot of hours with him in the situation room in the white house he is a consummate professional who has devo his entire professional career to protecting our country i was honored to receive his endorsement i will let his comments speak for themselves but i  i really apprecia his explaining as he did in his oped  some of what's at stake in this election
montenegro thank you madam secretary i believe we have a question from one of our panelists in the previous  could you stand up please
 my question is you've accused   of using racist and sexist language what does it say about the electorate that so many amans are supporting him
 well i  i really  i really believe that the core of his support  i'm not going to speak for everyone who supports him because i think there have been some quite distressing statements coming out of his rallies and his supporters and who has aligned themselves with him  but i think the core of his support really centers on the disappointment in the economy that so many amans feel and what i have been saying is you know i'm going to bring this country together i think we have three overarching goals we need more economic opportunity we need to protect our national security and we have got to work toward aman unity so i have been trying to understand what it is that has driven people to support  and i've met with some people i have listened to them and so many of them are loo for an explanation as to why they lost the job they had for  years when the factory closed and nobody cared about them what they're going to do when their whole life was spent mining coal and they made $ thousand a year now they can barely find a job ma minimum wage why the centers of so many old industrial towns in ama are hollowed out and people are turning to opiates and heroin and the list goes on and that's what i've heard so i think we have to recognize that of course some of the appeal is xenophobic and racist and misogynistic and offensive  we have to acknowledge that but let's not lose sight of the real pain that many amans are feeling because the economy has left them behind so i have said  i said it again in my acceptance speech last thursday i want to be the president for all amans i want to lift up and give everybody a chance to pursue their dreams and that means people who are supporting him when i went to west virginia i knew that i was not gonna win west virginia i can tell you that and i was in a meeting with a group of folks including a coal miner who was incredibly emotional and tal to me and outside there was a big  protest going on and one of the people at the protest for goodness sakes was blankenship who had just been convic of reckless indifference toward the wellbeing of his coal miners  causing deaths so clearly the lines are pretty stark but i have said you know i've got a plan for coal country i've got a plan for indian country i've got a plan for inner cities i've got a plan for rural communities it's one of the reasons as i said in my remarks that i support  clyburn's  proposal which would help all kinds of communities in ama  and i have talked about this so we have to reject and stand up against the appeals to the kind of bigotry and the use of bluster and bullying that we see coming from 's campaign but let's not forget the real economic challenges that too many amans of all backgrounds are facing today so that's how i think about it and that's how i'm going to try in this campaign to respond to and rebuke all of the horrible things he says on a pretty regular basis  but not about me i could care less about that
 but when he goes after individuals when he accuses a distinguished federal judge of mexican heritage of not being fair when he insults a gold star family of a muslim aman who served in the military  you know the list i will stand up and call him out on that but i will also keep reaching out to amans of all races and ethnicities and where ever they live to tell them that i am not going to forget about them after this election i'm going work my heart out to help every single person have a better job with a rising income and make sure their kids get a good education and everything else that i think they're owed here in ama
montenegro great wonderful and i think we have another question from our panel
 madam secretary ed o'keefe for the washington post thank you for being here and i think on behalf of all of us we encourage you to do this more often with reporters across the country  especially those news organizations that travel the country with you everywhere you go a majority of voters consistently say frankly they don't like you and they don't trust you and they say pretty much the e thing about   either you or mr  will be elec president how would you lead a nation where a majority of amans mistrust you and what extra responsibility might you have to show that you're up to the task
 well let me start by saying every e i have done a job people have coun on me and trus me and at the convention last week we highligh the fights of my life starting as a lawyer for the children's defense fund ta on the problem of juveniles in adult jails in south carolina segrega academies socalled in alabama fighting for kids with disabilities to get an education and all the way through the work i did as senator after / and representing all of you as secretary of state so there is  i  and i  i take this seriously don't you know don't doubt that i take it seriously you know it doesn't make me feel good when people say those things and i recognize that i have work to do but when i star running for the senate in new york a lot of the e things were said i won i worked hard for the people of new york and i was reelec with  percent of the vote after i demonstra that i would be on their side i would fight for the people i represen i ran a really hard campaign against   as i think everybody remembers it got a little contentious from e to e and to my surprise he turns around asks me to be secretary of state because he trus me and then i served as secretary of state and when i left i had a  percent approval rating so ask yourselves  were  percent of the people in new york wrong were  percent of the aman public wrong or maybe just maybe when i'm actually running for a job there is a real efit to those on the other side in trying to stir up as much concern as possible so i take it seriously and i'm going to work my heart out in this campaign and as president to produce results for people to get the economy to work for everybody not just those at the top to do as much as i can to help people who as i said earlier may not even vote for me because i think our country is at a crossroads election president  said it extremely well both in what his speech discussed in the convention what his press conferences since have poin out this is a crossroads election there is so much at stake you can look at my record of public service you can meet people and families who were efi by the children's health insurance program you can meet people who were efi by reforming the foster care and adoption system you can meet first responders and survivors from / who were efi because i went to bat for them you can meet national guards members and their families who didn't have health care unless they were deployed before i worked with s to fix that you can go down a long list and we'd be happy to provide it to you of what i have done because i believe in public service and i am proud that i've had the great great opportunity to work on behalf of giving more people a better life ever since i was right out of law school so i'm just going to get up every day and make my case and i think there'll be an opportunity for a lot of people to actually hear it
 madam secretary
 mmhmm
 kevin merida i'm editorinchief of the undefea at espn what is the most meaningful conversation you've had with an africanaman friend
 oh my gosh well could i tell you that i am blessed to have a  a crew of great friends and i've had two chiefs of staff who were my africanaman women friends maggie williams and cheryl mills i have been blessed to have people by my side in politics like minyon moore who is one of the leaders of my campaign i've had a great group of young people who i have been really motiva by and frankly learned from so i really have had a lifee of friendship going back to my college years when one of my best friends was an africanaman student so i can't compress into one conversation  they've suppor me they've chastised me they've raised issues with me they've tried to expand my musical tastes so we've had  we've had a lot of  we've had a lot of great great es because of our friendships so i can't really pick one conversation out of you know  years of conversation and i don't want to embarrass my friends peggy lewis is here she just became the dean of communications at trinity washington and i want to congratulate her donna brazile is here she's our acting chair of the dnc so i  i guess i'll leave it at that i think i'm going to  i'm going to respect the code of friendship silence but please know i've got a lot of great friends who have given me so much more
 madam secretary there's such little e and there's lots of questions and you're signaling us to  but i would be remiss we're in a room full of latino journalists and i have to ask you and give you an opportunity to respond and set the record clear does the  party does your campaign take latino voters seriously or are you ta them for gran that they will automatically vote 
 well i take them seriously because i've had the great privilege of wor for many years with latino leaders activists business men and women you know just as i responded to the question my first experience wor on behalf of latinos was  well actually even before i was a legal services lawyer through my church i babysat latino kids on saturdays while their parents and older siblings went to the fields outside of my home in chicago which used to be  hard to believe now miles of farmland it was my first real lesson in how much more we all have in common there i was  or  years old babysitting these little kids and at the end of the day the old ramshackle bus stopped at the end of the road and the parents and the older brothers and sisters got out and these little kids just broke loose and star running down that road with their arms outstretched calling for their mothers and their fathers and getting swept up in very tired arms and then when i was a little bit older my church arranged exchanges with latino churches we would go into the city of chicago sit in church basements talk about our lives and again it reinforced what to me was so much of a common sense of you know what we wan in our lives even though their lives and mine were very different and as a legal services lawyer  as the chair of the legal services corporation we expanded legal services into places against a lot of political opposition
 so i feel very fortunate that i've had the chance to work with and learn from so many latinas and latinos across ama when i ran for the senate i worked closely with our elec representatives both at the city state and national level i was honored that they rallied around to support me and were part of the great victory that we had in the primary in new york so no i don't take any voter for gran and i particularly don't take any voter who is placing their trust and confidence in me for gran because i am going to get up as i said every single day and work my heart out to get the results that i have told you we're going to achieve together and i know it's hard i've been around as you all know very well i'm not new to this it doesn't happen by hoping it happens or wishing it happens it happens by doing everything you possibly can and i am blessed to have such close wor relationships and friendships with latino leaders tonight at my house we will be having a big event with latino business leaders coming from around ama and so i'm going to do what i've always done you see i think at the core of political leadership is relationship you've got to build relationships with individuals and communities i know that doesn't happen by just as for it it happens because you work hard to achieve it so i'm going to do everything i can to make sure that any latino voter who votes for me knows that i'm going to be doing my best to deliver on everything that i've said and i will tell you as we go along what the challenges are because i may need to ask your help i may need you to put pressure on elec officials i may need you to flood the internet or flood the old fashioned mailbox of elec representatives so they know people are watching but that's how we're going to get it done and i'm actually pretty confident and opistic about that so i  that people will take this election seriously because i sure take you seriously and together i think we can create the kind of future that everyone of our kids and grandkids deserves thank you all very much
welker secretary  we are out of e we want to thank you very much everyone please give a big round of applause for secretary  for coming and answering our questions we really appreciate it and  your e thank you very much  (d) presidential candidate remarks at rally in omaha ne

(joined in progress)   (d)
presidential candidate to have a chance to stand before ama and to tell their stories because ama is story after story and what i want is to provide the opportunity and the support so that every single aman can live his or her best story can make the most of your own godgiven potential (cheering and applause)
 and after the convention was over starting friday morning   and his wonderful wife anne and  i and i got on a bus and star traveling across pennsylvania into ohio crosstalk
 we visi factories small towns bigger cities we met with so many hardwor people who told us their stories and they proved every day that   is wrong ama is not weak cheering and applause
 i agree with  this is the greatest nation on earth and our best days are still ahead of us cheering and applause
 now that doesn't mean we don't have challenges and problems of course we do right here at home and around the world [] but i don't believe there is anything that amans can't do if we make up our minds because you know why we are stronger together cheering and applause
 but as  said too many people haven't gotten a raise since the great crash there's too much inequality and too little opportunity washington is paralyzed by special interests and big money but don't let anyone tell you we don't have what it takes if we make up our minds to solve our problems and don't believe anyone who tells you i alone can fix it laughter cheering and applause
 when   said that in his convention speech i did a bit of a mental doubletake i listened to that speech  minutes of it and it was like he was tal about a different country forgetting about everyone in ama who gets up every day and works together people who make a difference every single day cheering and applause
 he's forgetting our troops on the front lines he's forgetting police officers and firefighters who run toward danger he's forgetting about doctors and nurses who save lives and teachers who change lives he's forgetting about unions who fight for wor families and communities that pull together through hard es cheering and applause
 i grew up in the midwest i was born in chicago raised outside of chicago my dad was a small businessman i mean really small it was mostly just him and occasionally my mother my brothers and me and somees he would hire helpers to get one of his orders out because he prin fabrics to be made into draperies and he had a print plant with long tables he was a very selfreliant man but i don't think he for a minute through his growing up in scranton pennsylvania through his service as a chief petty officer in the navy through his work and business or his raising our family ever thought to himself i alone can fix it that's just not the way we were raised we were raised to get together we were raised to follow up on the extraordinary example of our founders  years ago in philadelphia who came together you see that across nebraska you see people wor i have been in omaha i have visi projects schools other kinds of nonprofits and institutions where people are wor together that's what we do in ama we see a problem and we say we will fix it together and that's what we're going to do when we get the white house to move us forward in the direction we need to go cheering and applause
 now i know how hard the great recession was it was a terrible e the worst financial crisis since the great depression and people in nebraska worked hard to come back i think it was a terrible moment it could have gotten even worse i believe that a lot of difficult decisions had to be made and we have come back from that terrible financial crisis thanks to the hard work of nebraskans amans and president  we got out of the ditch we were in cheering and applause
 so i think if we're going to solve the problems we have we ought to be really clear about where we have come from we now have  million new jobs that have been crea in the last sevenandahalf years we now have  million more amans who have access to health care cheering and applause []
 we have the highest percentage ever in our history of young people wal across graduation stages to get their high school diplomas cheering and applause
 so i know we have made progress but i know we shouldn't be satisfied as amans we always have to be as ourselves what can we do better how can we make more progress how can we help more people we're still facing tough challenges that developed long before the recession and they have stayed with us the economy is not wor the way it should for everyone crosstalk
 starting in iowa back in april of  until the convention this week i have met so many people who tell me you know they don't expect a handout they don't even expect you know life to be easy but they don't think it should be this hard it shouldn't be that people feel like they're out there on their own like no one cares about them that they're not respec that the dignity of their job is not something that we all support i know a lot of people who feel that way i bet there are some in this gymnasium who feel that way well here's what i want you to know you deserve a president who will get up every single day in the white house and do everything she can to give you the chance you deserve to have cheering and applause
    
 and i will quickly add as important as it is to have someone who gets what you're going through i think it's also really important that that person tells you what her plans are for producing results cheering and applause
 so if you saw what i said on thursday night let me give you the short punchier version and it starts by ma clear we do have to rewrite the rules so that our economy works for everyone not just those at the top cheering and applause my overriding mission as president will be to do everything i can to help our country create more jobs with rising incomes i believe anyone willing to work hard should be able to find a job that pays well enough to support a family cheering and applause
 so in my first  days we are going to break through the gridlock in washington and make the biggest investment in new goodpaying jobs since world war ii we are going to make the boldest investment in aman infrastructure since the highway system cheering and applause
  read you some of the quotes from   well he has said so many things that i profoundly vehemently disagree with and for the life of me i don't know why someone runs to be president of the uni states who thinks and says we never win anymore our country is full of losers well he could not be more wrong we are going to fix and build the roads the bridges the tunnels the ports the airports the water systems we need cheering and applause
 and i want to say a particular word to any of you here from rural nebraska we are going to bring diverse economic development to rural communities to support our farmers and others in small towns who keep ama going cheering and applause
 and one specific way we will do that is to make sure we have an electric grid that can take and distribute energy from clean renewable sources  cheering and applause
 in fact i know because i've seen them in the crowd there are few people from iowa here today and your neighbor iowa is already getting onethird of its electricity from clean energy primarily wind energy cheering and applause
 and what i love about them is they're also giving farmers extra income for hosting the turbines on their farm and they are ta abandoned factories and actually assembling the wind turbines putting people to work in iowa to produce the energy for iowa cheering and applause
 the other thing we're going to do is finish the job of building out broadband so everybody in ama no matter where you live has access to the internet cheering and applause ends in progress   presidential candidate delivers remarks at the aman legion national convention (sd)

 good afternoon i am deligh to have this great honor of being here and having this opportunity to address you i want to thank the national commander  thank you commander barnett i want to thank verna jones your executive director and dewey mothe  inaudible commander and i want to thank a longe friend and adviser to me someone whom i am very grateful to and that is your national treasurer  buskirk most of all thanks to you all the legionnaires here and across ama thanks for your service in our armed forces you wore the uniform you took an oath you put your life on the line to protect the greatest country on earth  there are some who may argue with that but not around me
 when you came home you joined the aman legion and by doing so you kept serving just look at what the legion does you care for wounded warriors you help raise the next generation of aman patriots i want to give a special shout out to boys nation which meant so much to my husband when he was growing up and when i told him i was coming here today he said you've got to mention boys nation i told him i would but i also have to mention girls nation too  i want to thank your auxiliary the world's largest women's patriotic service organization  i was honored to receive the auxiliary's public spirit award in  and i have great admiration for the work you do as a daughter of a veteran as a proud aman i am grateful to you all now i'm not going to talk a lot about politics today but i do want to say this whoever ama elects this fall won't just be our next president that person will be our next commander in chief and every person in this room understands how great a responsibility that is now i know some of you are s and some of you are s and some of you are independents i suppose there are some of you who've never vo for a  before i get that my dad was a rock red  but i learned at our dinner table that we can disagree without being disagreeable  i want you to know if i am fortunate enough to win this election i will be a president for s s independents for people who vote for me for people who don't for all amans that is what i think we need we need to unify our country and go forward into the future with confidence and opism  today i want you to know a little bit about where i stand and how i see the world and ama's place in it i spent four years as your secretary of state eight years before that as senator from the great state of new york six years on the senate armed services comee if there's one core belief that has guided and inspired me every step of the way it is this the uni states is an exceptional nation i believe we are still 's last best  of earth we're still reagan's shining city on a hill we're still robert kennedy's great unselfish compassionate country and it's not just that we have the greatest military or that our economy is larger than any on earth it's also the strength of our values the strength of the aman people everyone who works harder dreams bigger and never ever stops trying to make our country and the world a better place and part of what makes ama an exceptional nation is that we are also an indispensable nation in fact we are the indispensable nation people all over the world look to us and follow our lead my friends we are so lucky to be amans it is an extraordinary blessing it's why so many people from so many places want to be amans too but it's also a serious responsibility the decisions we make and the actions we take even the actions we don't take affect millions even ions of lives
 you know that you've seen it now all of this may seem evident especially to men and women who have worn the uniform you may wonder how anyone could disagree but in fact my opponent in this race has said very clearly that he thinks aman exceptionalism is insulting to the rest of the world in fact when   of all people criticized aman exceptionalism my opponent agreed with him saying and i quote if you're in russia you don't want to hear that ama is exceptional well maybe you don't want to hear it but that doesn't mean it's not true my opponent misses something important when we say ama is exceptional it doesn't mean that people from other places don't feel deep national pride just like we do it means that we recognize ama's unique and unparalleled ability to be a force for peace and progress a champion for freedom and opportunity our power comes with a responsibility to lead humbly thoughtfully and with a fierce commitment to our values because when ama fails to lead we leave a vacuum that either causes chaos or other countries or networks rush in to fill the void so no matter how hard it gets no matter how great the challenge ama must lead the question is how we lead what kind of ideas strategies and tactics we bring to our leadership aman leadership means standing with our allies because our network of allies is part of what makes us exceptional no other country in the world has alliances like ours russia and china have nothing close we stand with our allies because generations of aman troops fought and died to secure those bonds and because they deliver for us every day our allies share intelligence on terrorists they provide staging areas for our military so we can respond quickly to events on the other side of the world other nations' soldiers sailors airmen and marines often fight side by side with ours some of you may have served and fought alongside men and women from other countries you say them in action you know how important these bonds are to our security threatening to walk away from our alliances ignoring the importance that they still are to us is not only wrong it's dangerous if i'm  if i'm your president our friends will always know ama will have your backs and we expect you to have ours aman leadership means bringing the world together to solve global problems as only we can the uni states built the international coalition against isis now we're wor with partners to take back territory and defeat them without getting drawn in to a ground war we brought the world together to impose sanctions on iran and secure a deal that puts a lid on iran's nuclear program without firing a single shot you don't build a coalition by insulting our friends or acting like a loose cannon you do it by putting in the slow hard work of building relationships getting countries wor together was my job every day as your secretary of state it's more than a photo op it takes consistency and reliability
 actually it's just like building personal relationships people have to get to know that they can count on you that you won't say one thing one day and something totally different the next and it certainly takes more than trying to make up for a year of insults and insinuations by dropping in on our neighbors for a few hours and then flying home again that is not how it works aman leadership means leading with our values in pursuance of our interests in protection of our security at our best the uni states is the global force for freedom justice and n dignity we celebrate our diversity  as a source of national strength just look at our armed forces which represents all races religions ethnicities and yes immigrants from other countries all fighting for the red white and blue we stand up to regimes that abuse n rights we stand up for religious and ethnic minorities for women for people with disabilities and we comport ourselves with honor there's no better proof of that than what our navy seals did during the raid to kill oa bin laden  i was deeply honored to be part of that small group advising the president i brought to those discussions my experience as a senator from new york on / and my commitment to do whatever i could in whatever role i had to bring bin laden to justice you've all seen the picture of us crowded into the smaller situation room watching the video screen every second coun one of the copters misgauged how high the wall was around the courtyard clipped the tail getting disabled it didn't stop the seals from rushing out getting into the compound returning fire against bin laden's body guards ta on his adult son and finally bin laden himself but the seals knew that they had to destroy the helicopter before they left i was holding my breath through the entire operation because at anye pakistani soldiers could have arrived this compound was in a military garrisoned city actually the home of their military academy so yes every second coun but still our seals took the e to move the women and children bin laden's family members to safety before destroying the helicopter that is what honor looks like that is ama at our best  maybe the soldiers of other nations wouldn't have bothered or maybe they'd have taken revenge on those family members of terrorists but that is not who we are and anyone who doesn't understand that doesn't understand what makes our nation great and let me say something else about aman greatness there's no question we face real threats and real enemies that we need to confront and defeat but my opponent is wrong when he says ama is no longer great consider the record of the past either years
 in  our global economy was collapsing oa bin laden was plotting we had more than  troops fighting two wars iran was racing toward a nuclear weapon many of our allies were less supportive of aman leadership than they had been in decades look where we are now we have pulled the global economy out of freefall thanks to the hard work and sacrifice of the aman people we have redeployed well over  troops from iraq and afghanistan so they can go home rest and train for future contingencies we cut off iran's path to a nuclear weapon we convinced russia to reduce their nuclear weapons arsenal we protec our ally israel and we brought oa bin laden to justice we did that we amans did all of that wor together across party lines and there is no question we have more work to do but let's be clear  we are stronger together and it will be my goal if i am fortunate enough to be your president to bring people back together again to set our goals and move forward to achieve them  i know that we can't cozy up to dictators we have to stand up to them we can't contain isis we must defeat them and we will we will do whatever is necessary for as long as it takes to bring them to justice and end their reign of terror once and for all this election is about how to make things better now make no mistake i believe we do have better days ahead but things could also get worse if more countries get nuclear weapons if we abandon our allies if our commanderinchief orders our military to break the laws and commit torture or murder terrorists' family members that is why it is so critical we get this right and let me underscore what i have said throughout this campaign we must only send our troops into harm's way as a last resort not a first choice that must be our bedrock principle  but we must be able to act decisively on our own when we need to i completely reject anyone including my opponent who calls the aman military and i quote a disaster that is an insult to the men and women serving today and all who have served before who put their lives on the line it's just not true we do have more work to do to continue to have the strongest most effective military in the world i know this is something that matters a great deal to everyone in this room and here is what we have to do we cannot lose our military edge and that means giving the pentagon the stable predictable funding it needs to make smart investments  you've heard of a sequester the arbitrary caps that congress has imposed on our entire government for the past several years look i am all for cutting the fat out of the budget and ma sure we stretch our dollars i am proud of the fact that when my husband left office we had a balanced budget and a surplus and i  that someday we can get back to doing that but we cannot impose arbitrary limits on something as important as our military that makes no sense at all the sequester makes our country less secure let's end it and get a budget deal that supports ama's military our families and our country and let's make reform a priority so that the defense department spends its budget on the right things and by the way the last thing we need is a president who brings more namecalling and temper tantrums to washington we've got to get people listening to each other again getting both parties actually to work together
 let's modernize our army and marines our navy and air force our coast guard we need to respond to evolving threats from states like russia china iran and north korea from networks criminal and terrorist networks like isis we need a military that is ready and agile so it can meet the full range of threats and operate on short notice across every domain not just land sea air and space but also cyberspace we'll invest in new technology so new breakthrough's can transform our military just as stealth precision weapons and advance communications did in the past we'll make a renewed push to reduce the world's nuclear weapons because that does make us all safer and we'll step up our efforts to secure nuclear material around the world and stop terrorists from acquiring or using weapons of mass destruction one of the first things i will do as president is to call for a new nuclear posture review we have to make sure that ama's arsenal is prepared to meet future threats we'll invest in the next frontier of military engagement protecting us interests in outer space and cyberspace you've seen reports russia's hacked into a lot of things china's hacked into a lot of things russia even hacked into the  national comee maybe even some state election systems so we've got to step up our game make sure we are well defended and able to take the fight to those who go after us as president i will make it clear that the uni states will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack we will be ready with serious political economic and military responses and we're going to invest in protecting our governmental networks and our national infrastructure i want us to lead the world in setting the rules of cyberspace if ama doesn't others will so in short we have to be ready to win today's fights and tomorrow's but you know that the most important thing isn't the size of our military or the sophistication of our weapons the most important thing is our people the men and women who put on the uniform and serve we need to  we need to take a hard look at our military's personnel policies to make sure we are doing everything to attract and keep the best and the brightest who volunteer we need to support not only them but also their families and as president i will never forget the debt we owe to our veterans and your families who also served i will never ever disrespect gold star families who've made the ulate sacrifice for our nation  or prisoners of war who endured so much in our name  to insult them is just so wrong and it says a lot about the person doing the insulting in the senate i worked with s to increase the efit paid to gold star families to expand access to military health insurance to make sure all members of the guard and reserves and their families have access to health efits whether they're deployed or training at home i fought successfully to amend the  defense appropriations act to establish a training program for family caregivers helping loved ones with traumatic brain injuries senator  mccain and i joined forces to personally raise money for a state of the art rehab facility at brooke army medical center in san antonio to help seriously wounded service members coming home from iraq and afghanistan like you i was outraged by the scandals at va hospitals people waiting for months or years for wheelchairs and basic medications some even dying while waiting for an appointment i know that you heard from secretary mc and i know how hard he and his team are wor we are going to build a st century department of veterans affairs that delivers worldclass care and we are not going to let anyone privatize the va we're going to reform and strengthen it not privatize it
 we will ensure access to ely quality care for all of our veterans improve care for women who are often underserved identify and treat all wounds of war visible and invisible including agent orange and gulf war syndrome and traumatic brain injury and ptsd we will end the epidemic of veteran suicides by expanding access to mental health care and fighting the stigma that isolates too many of our veterans from getting the care that they need  i feel passionately about this because i have looked into the eyes of too many family members who have lost their loved one to suicide that's why just two days ago when i released my plan to improve mental health services for all amans i included a specific section about more help for veterans and their families because we know too many aren't getting the help they need right now we've got to serve them just as they served us we are also going to help more veterans loo for jobs with expanded tax credits for businesses that hire veterans more support to veterans who want to start their own businesses and ma it easier for veterans to get credit for the skills they learned while serving  and we will crack down on forprofit schools and companies that prey on or discriminate against service members veterans or military families they should be ashamed of themselves and we're going to hold them accountable we will also work closely with the aman legion to clean up and expedite the appeals process efits should be delivered as quickly as possible and appeals should be decided as expeditiously as possible i thank you for the work you are doing on that now a lot of what i have mentioned has support from s and s maintaining our military and caring for our veterans should never be a partisan issue defending aman exceptionalism should always be above politics but this is not a normal election the debates are not the normal disagreements between s and s so i  you will listen carefully to what my opponent and i propose consider our plans and the values behind them and after you've given us both a fair hearing i  you will join the growing number of amans s s and independents who are supporting our vision for the kind of future that we want for our country this election shouldn't be about ideology it's not just about differences over policy it truly is about who has the experience and the temperament to serve as president and commanderinchief just three weeks ago   national security experts who served in prior  administrations wrote a letter saying that they will not vote for   because he would be in their words the most reckless president in aman history  by contrast i am deeply honored to have so many retired military leaders bac me along with these  experts i'm suppor by people on both sides of the aisle and both sides of the debates that have defined our foreign policy for the last  years they know i believe in a bipartisan foreign policy they know i believe we should be finding ways to bring our country together around national security our role in the world our values they know they can count on me to do that and what matters to them is that we make the right choice in november
 the stakes this fall are as high as any election in our lifees so i'm going to keep raising these issues keep telling people where i stand laying out plans for what i'd do if elec i have to tell you it is a little funny to me i get criticized for having so many plans people say oh there she goes with another plan about mental health about veterans well i have this old fashioned idea if i'm as for your vote for president i should tell you what i want to do as your president so yes i have laid out plans and i'm going to work my heart out to implement those plans and if i win this fall no one will work harder for our troops our veterans and our military families this is personal to me starting with my dad his name was hugh rodham he enlis in the navy shortly after pearl harbor he became a chief petty officer at great lakes north of chicago responsible for training thousands of young sailors before they shipped out to sea mostly to the pacific theater after my dad died i received letters from men who had served under him i treasure them to this day my father told me how emotional he got when he accompanied his trainees to the west coast and saw those young sailors get onboard their ships he knew some of them wouldn't survive but he believed in their cause he believed in them and they went to serve to protect our country they knew their country needed them over the course of the last years i've also had the privilege of wor with helping and supporting so many active duty and retired military members and families first as first lady then as senator then as secretary of state whenever i would go anywhere representing you and be privileged to meet with the men and women who serve our country i would sit down if we had a chance and hear what was on their minds would shake hands and take pictures somees bring messages back to their loved ones and i too knew that some of those young men and women wouldn't be coming home either it's that kind of courage and honor that our men and women in uniform demonstrate every single day  i will never forget that and i would expect the aman legion to be my partner in the white house to make sure i never do you and all our veterans deserve nothing less our respect our thanks but you also disserve a country that honors your service not just with words but with deeds that's why the aman legion is so critical wor everyday to make sure ama lives up to that standard i will be doing that work right alongside you if i am given the great honor to serve as your president and commander in chief thank you all god bless you and god bless the uni states of ama thank you 
 secretary  i'd love to give you one of our medallions inscribed are the words for god and country thank you for your kind words to our veterans your support of veterans and we wish you the very best

families that you know they are not poor families they are wor people but they don't make enough money and they don't work for somebody who provides insurance and so very often their kids were being

nothing we can do for her but this mother like many mothers i know did not take that for an answer right she got on the internet she began to research and she found that there were treatments that she could maybe provide to her little daughter but they were expensive and she and her husband didn't have that kind of money and they didn't have insurance she was at her doctor's office and just so

just someone to vote against that's why   and i have run a campaign based on ideas and issues not insults cheers because if you really take a look at what's at stake in this election it is a choice between two very different visions for ama i've got to say when i hear my opponent talk about ama i don't recognize the country he's tal about it is so dark so divisive so hateful that is not the ama that i believe in i believe that we should have a confident opistic inclusive vision of where we're going and how we're going to get there cheers i love our country and i believe in the aman people and i think there's nothing we can't achieve if we work together and we set some goals and we go after them \ cheers see we believe in an ama that is bighear not small minded we believe in an ama that is already great but can be greater if we do our part cheers and we believe ama is great because ama is good never forget that if we lift each other up and not tear each other down we can go even further and i believe with all my heart that's why the slogan of my campaign sums it up that we are stronger together cheers and so come next january th ama is going to have a new president cheers i know that a lot of people say that they want change well let me tell you this change is inevitable there will be change the question is what kind of change are we going to have cheers are we going to build a stronger fairer better country or are we going to fear the future and each other i sure  not that is not the ama that i believe we are so here's what i want to ask you to do i want you to talk to your friends and your family your neighbors michigan is one of these states that doesn't have early voting i've been all over the country going to states that are already voting in fact about  million to  million people have already vo in those states but michigan votes on tuesday cheers and i imagine i imagine there are some of you who know people who say they're going to vote for   right boos i know i understand that i mean i would  you'd try to stage an intervention before it's too late cheers but maybe you can ask them with you to imagine imagine january th  and imagine that my opponent is ta the oath of office in front of the capitol boos imagine having a president who demeans women and mocks the disabled who insults africanamans and latinos and muslims boos who personally engages in busting unions and preventing people from having the right to bargain collectively boos now the truth is we really don't have to imagine what that would be like because everything he has said and done both in his career and in this campaign tells you what could happen you know   who says so many wise and wonderful things cheers she said the presidency doesn't change who you are it reveals who you are and i think we've seen who   is maya angelou another great aman maya angelou said when someone shows you who he is believe him the first e cheers and if my opponent were to win we would have a president who has only ever been in it for himself just last year he said again it wouldn't have mattered if we'd rescued the auto industry or let it go bankrupt boos what is he tal about i'm proud that president  saved the auto industry cheers and i'm even prouder that because of the hard work of people in detroit and across michigan and the midwest the us auto industry just had its best year ever cheers if  wins the election we have a president who wants to ban every muslim in the world from coming to visit the uni states boos we are a country founded our religious freedom that runs contrary to our constitution we would have a president who has said repealy that he thinks the lives of the black people are all about crime and poverty and despair boos he has no idea about the strength of the black church in the vibrancy of blackowned businesses the excellence of historically black colleges and universities cheers he seems to know nothing about the rise of a new generation of black activists and the success of black leaders in every field cheers i think he needs a visit from reverend wendell  don't you cheers yesterday in north carolina i was honored to stand with a woman named may brown wiggins decades ago she was a hardwor nurse in new york city she was loo for an apartment that she could afford to rent but   and his father fred turned her away you see whenever africanamans tried to rent  apartments their application was marked with a c c for colored boos and that didn't sit very well with may so she went to the authorities and eventually the department of justice sued the s for housing discrimination cheers and although they settled they wouldn't change so the government had to take them back to court that's a pattern this is what happens e and e again with my opponent if he were to win he would be in charge of the federal housing department if he doesn't respect all amans now how can we trust him to serve all amans in the future cheers he has such a casual disregard of our constitution he doesn't seem to understand that the rule of law that we really are a nation of laws not men cheers here's the latest example there is a terrible crime back in  in new york city it was called the central park five maybe some of you have heard of it there were five black and latino kids some as young as  they were wrongfully convic and they were in prison where they spent years   took out fullpage ads calling for the death penalty for the kids and even after they were exonera by dna evidence as someone else confessed to that terrible crime  actually said they should still be in prison boos it doesn't matter if you are innocent if he decides that you should be in prison or you should be locked up laughter cheers no wonder he admires   because that's exactly what  does to his people cheers so we can't trust him with our constitution we can't trust him to obey the rule of law he has shown us who he is now we have to decide who we are so let me paint you a different picture here's what we're going to do together if we win this election on tuesday night cheers we have three big three big challenges number one we've got to get the economy wor for everyone not just those at the top cheers number two we've got to keep our country safe and we have to work with our allies to lead the world with strength and intelligence for peace and prosperity cheers and number three we've got to bring our country together we've got to overcome these divides we have to heal our nation and i  that you will help me meet all three of those challenges cheers i have said repealy that we're going to take on discrimination and bigotry because any e we hold somebody back it can lead to holding other people back we can't accept as normal what we're seeing across our country because of his campaign a church in mississippi was burned this week someone pain vote  on the side and then set it on fire boos we can't let that happen what happened in flint michigan should not be normal or acceptable cheers applause our kids should be guaranteed clean air and clean water those are basics and we've got to do everything we can to make sure that we take care of our children and it's important for us to recognize that when i talk about getting the economy to work for everybody that means i want the biggest jobs program since world war ii infrastructure advanced manufacturing clean renewable energy technology cheers some people say we can't do that well i'm telling you they are wrong they are wrong we have the best workers the most productive workers we're going to give them more to work on more products to produce cheers and we're going to do more for small business because small business is the backbone of so many communities cheers i want everybody to have the chance to succeed in ama that means we're going to dismantle the socalled school to prison pipeline and replace it with a cradle to college pipeline cheers we're going to make sure that every child has a chance to go to a good school with good teachers no matter what zip code that child lives in cheers and i want to start with our youngest kids with prekindergarten program and then i want to be able to partner with our teachers we've got to have high expectations and get results in helping our children and i want to be sure that we put technical education back into high school because there are good jobs out there waiting for young people with the skills to do them cheers it will be important that we create an environment in which our police and our communities can work together and trust each other i believe we are all safer when everyone has respect for the law and everyone is respec by the law and that's what we're going to work for cheers we're also going to take commonsense steps to reduce gun violence and save lives cheers this has nothing to do with the scare tactics coming from my opponent have you seen he's starting to wear a camo hat now really we are going to work with responsible gun owners who understand that we've got to keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them in the first place cheers and while we create more safe communities we want to invest in those communities i want to continue the good work that our past two  presidents have done one named  one named  cheers and i want to be a really strong partner i'll compete a little with them but i want to be a real strong partner with detroit and other cities that are on the way back up to make sure you get the investment and the support the housing and the jobs that you need but we also have to make sure our economy is fairer that's why i believe we should raise the national minimum wage because people who work fulle should not be left in poverty cheers and isn't it finally e to guarantee equal pay for women cheers this is not a woman's issue if you have a wife a mother a daughter or a sister who works it's your issue it's a family issue and every e i talk about wanting to have affordable childcare paid family leave equal pay for women the other side accuses me of playing the woman's card i'll tell you what if standing up for equal pay is playing the woman's card then deal me in cheers and one of the other one of the other big challenges we're going to take on i am so exci about this you know i'm really proud of the campaign that   and i ran because it was a campaign about issues and what we decided after it was over is how we can work together to make sure that everybody who wants to go to college can afford not just to start but actually to graduate cheers so we came up with a plan that if you go to a public college or university you will go tuition free if your family makes less than $ a year cheers and it will be debtfree for everybody above that so you don't go into debt cheers for people who already have student debt we're going to help you pay it down and pay it off to get out from under it cheers and i want especially to support historically black colleges and universities that have done so much to bring forth a leadership cadre in our country this is just some of what we are offering in this campaign because we really believe you need to look at what will happen after the election now i had a friend say to me the other day you know people are just frustra and angry i get that i understand that we had the worst economic collapse since the great depression in ' and ' millions of people lost their jobs millions lost their homes family wealth was wiped out that is a trauma and people are still suffering and still climbing back from that i get it but i learned a long e ago from my late mother anger is not a plan all right be angry vent about it and then roll up your sleeves and get to work cheers that's what i will do that's why we put this all down it's on our website com it's in a book that   and i put out called stronger together because not only do i want you to know what i will try to do as your president i want you to hold me accountable i want you cheers i want you when i come back to detroit which i will do when i travel around michigan which i will do i want you to say well how's it going getting those new jobs star how much progress are we ma on ma sure college is affordable i believe in ma lists maybe it's a woman's thing cheers my husband said to me one e you have lists of your lists well i do because i want to know what we're going to get done and how we can make progress together and ulately this election really is about the kind of country we want for our kids and in my case now my grandkids are we really a nation that believes in freedom and justice for all are we really a nation that recognizes our best years can still be ahead of us if we make up our minds to have that be our goal cheers i believe we can do this together my opponent at his convention said i alone can fix it well no nobody alone does anything when our founders met in philadelphia it wasn't one person creating our country it was many people wor together and fighting a revolution to get that democracy and then to fight for civil rights and voting rights and workers rights and women's rights and lgbt rights cheers none of them none of them were won by one person alone the aman labor movement didn't happen to get somebody one day say i alone make it happen it took millions of people in every one of these movements marching and spea out and sitting in   wasn't put into the white house by one person alone it took everybody wor and organizing and yes voting that is how progress happens in ama cheers so really it all comes down to you my friends you have to vote our progress is on the line everything that has happened up until this point is on the line i'm ready to defend and build on the progress that we've made i'm proud i was a member of president 's cabinet i'm proud that he and i are friends cheers but he knows and i know that aman leadership aman presidents it's like running a relay you do your very best and then you pass off the baton and you just  that the person you had it off to doesn't drop to the ground or doesn't turn around and run back the way we came from which is what my opponent is promising to do cheers now i've told the president that when he hands off the baton he's going to have to d over he's a lot taller than i am but i'm exci about what we can do i know this is been a tough campaign i've got people coming up to me saying they've got migraines they never had before they have stomachaches that they don't know what they're going to do with i get it it has been in many ways a really tough campaign but i'll tell you what michigan you can make the difference cheers all i'm as you is talk to your friends talk to your family talk to your coworkers talk to everybody if you have e to volunteer go to com to volunteer or text join because when your children  and there are some beautiful children in this crowd here today cheers when your children or grandchildren ask what you did in  when everything was on the line i want you to be able to say i vo for a better stronger fairer ama cheers an ama where we build bridges not walls cheers and where we prove once and for all that love s hate let's get to work thank you detroit thank you michigan god bless you   presidential candidate delivers remarks at a campaign event in tampa florida (sd/)

 thank you so much
 happy birthday happy birthday happy birthday 
 thank you wow thank you all what a great way to celebrate my birthday being here in tampa  i am so so grateful to jose for that wonderful introduction he's an incredibly talen chef but more than that i have to say he's a nitarian he just came back from haiti once again where he goes periodically to help feed people he's been doing it ever since the terrible earthquake going to help people in remote villages and he does that all over the world when it comes to ma sure that there are clean cook stoves so that people can cook primarily women and children without fear of getting sick from inhaling all the smoke i enlis jose's help when i was secretary of state on the clean cook stoves initiative and as you heard he's also a proud immigrant and  he is standing up to  's antiimmigrant rhetoric and he's doing it in a very courageous way because he sacrificed his business he'd been asked by the  organization to put a restaurant into the new hotel that  was tal about on tv today in washington and after jose heard the kinds of things that   was saying about immigrants he said no i refuse to open a restaurant in that hotel  that is really gutsy and today was as perfect e to have jose be with us because as i said   is ta e off the campaign trail to officially open the hotel and yesterday here in florida he took e out to invite the press to listen to his employees talk about what a great boss he is while he was watching and listening to them and today in opening that hotel i think it's important to note that he once again relied on undocumen workers the e people he has been insulting and demonizing throughout this campaign so like with so much else that   says he says one thing and then he does something different many of the products in the hotel were made overseas rather than here in the uni states and he even sued the district of columbia to pay lower taxes that is the way that he does business now  we've actually learned in this campaign that   is the poster boy for everything wrong with our economy  he refuses to pay workers and contractors from atlantic city to miami to las vegas he stiffs small businesses i take that one personally because my dad was a small business man and i've met so many people who did projects for   you know provided pianos for one of his casinos installed drapes for one of his hotels laid the marble put in the glass washed the dishes pain and then weren't paid
 i just think that is fundamentally wrong and that is not the kind of experience we need in the oval office so i'm grateful to jose and i want to thank everyone else my great friend your uni states senator  nelson  congresswoman kathy castor  mayor bob buckhorn who's here with his two daughters  governor charlie crist soon to be congressman charlie crist  i have to say we've got two great candidates here  singer candidate for the house of representatives and rena frazier another candidate and we have the great talent of angela bassett with us today  so my friends here's the advice that i got it is a beautiful day in tampa but it's warm and some of you have been here a while right and i'm watching the flags so long as they're waving i know there's a breeze if they stop waving i'm really going to cut this short but let me start by than you than you for being here and 
   
 thank you thank you well i'll tell you if i ever need a you know pickup i'm coming back to tampa mayor  and you know with  days left in this election we cannot stop for a minute no complacency here nobody  nobody flagging we've got to get everybody out to vote and i  in addition to the people that i mentioned someone who's not here i  you will support that is congressman pat murphy to send him to the uni states senate i think you'll be pleased because he's an independent voice he's a problemsolver he believes in comprehensive immigration reform he has stood with planned parenthood against the attacks that it has suffered he's even brought s and s together to try to protect our environment and fund everglades restoration he will stand up to the gun lobby and advocate for common sense gun safety measures he'll defend social security and medicare not cutting or privatizing those two essential programs so please do your best to make sure we send pat murphy to the senate now i got to ask you did anybody see the last debate  you know i have now stood next to   for fouranda half hours proving conclusively that i have the stamina to do the job  and every e he says one of those outrageous things that he does have a  yes wrong  he does have a way of saying i just keep remembering  's words when he goes low we go high  but i've got to say he said something in the last debate we've never heard from anybody running for president he basically said that he's not sure  he refused to say that he would respect the results of the election now this is a guy that said the emmys were rigged so you can't really take what he says you know very seriously but this is a problem because the first thing a president does at noon on january th is to take an oath to preserve protect and defend the constitution and if you are casting doubts you want to keep people in suspense as to whether you will respect the outcome of an election that is contrary to who we are as amans we have our elections we've had them from  washington forward and we're going to keep having them and show what a democracy looks like to the rest of the world  i believe strongly that the aman people are going to reject this dark divisive vision of ama and it's happening my friends we have reached a milestone more than  million amans are registered to vote that's the biggest number ever and that number includes  million young people  and you know what else more than  million people have already vo including  million right here in florida  i'm hearing some great stories from people let me just tell you one it's about stephen  from saint augustine he's been fighting a rare form of leukemia and heart disease he's been in and out of the hospital a dozen es in the last two years but he knows how important his vote is so i heard yesterday he ditched his oxygen tank which i would not have recommended laughter  clung to his  stood in line so he could cast his vote for a better ama and  if stephen  can do that nobody has any excuses and i think this extends not just to s but to s and independents and i am proud to have support from s and independents here across florida and across ama   who agree with me that we should reject hate and division we have seen   insult nearly every person in ama and i just  i just find that so intolerable because look at this diverse crowd look at tampa it's a cosmopolitan city  florida  florida is paving the way for what our country will look like and we need to be lifting each other up listening to each other respecting each other not sewing seeds of hatred and bigotry and i think one of my biggest jobs after this election will be bringing our country together and i'm gonna need your help  we're going to get the economy wor for everybody not just people at the top with new jobs and infrastructure that  that rail that system bob  that you want we're going to get it because it would help you so much  think of the people we'd put to work technology innovation research advanced manufacturing and yes small business i want to be the best small business president you can have to help people start and grow their businesses  but we're also going to make ama the clean energy super power of the st century  i know we can create millions of jobs and we can protect florida especially coastal florida and we could protect our planet at the e e you know you're already seeing the results of climate change here in florida you know i was just in miami and they actually have flooding on sunny days with no rain people are calling  because they think a water main broke but it's the oceans rising so i know there is no state that could efit more from a clean energy agenda than florida and that's exactly what we're gonna do  we're also gonna make public colleges and universities tuition free  if your family makes less than $ which is most families in ama you're not gonna have to pay a penny to go to a public college or university  if your family makes more than that you're not gonna have to go into debt pay what you can afford and then we're going to make sure you can go without getting a big debt because that drags people down  and for people who already have debt we are going to help you refinance it and pay it off  and i wanna say something to all of the teachers and educators i want to work with you and be a good partner with you and i think there should be more than one way more than just a fouryear college degree to get a good job with a good middle classlife for you and your family  so let's invest in more technical education in high school and our community colleges let's have more apprenticeship programs labor and business together  but while we grow the economy let's make it fairer we need to raise the national minimum wage so that people who work fulle aren't left in poverty  you know i gotta tell you i was raised to believe in hard work my grandfather was a factory worker my dad had a small business and we really believed you gotta work for what you get in life right but if you're wor you shouldn't be at the point where you cannot even afford food or clothes or rent at the end of the year  and isn't it finally e to guarantee equal pay for women's work  you know this is not just a women's issue this is a family issue if you've got a mother a wife a sister or a daughter wor it's your issue  and unlike my opponent we're going to ask the wealthy the millionaires and ionaires to pay their fair share because we're going to close the loopholes and make sure no multimillionaire ever pays a lower tax rate than a nurse or a teacher or a police officer or a fire fighter  and i will not raise taxes on anyone ma less than $ a year  so when you go to the polls vote to grow the economy more jobs with  rising income vote to make the economy fairer and compare that with what my opponent has proposed he really believes if you give trillions  that's trillions with a t  trillions in tax cuts to the wealthy millionaires ionaires big corporations everything will tle down now we know that doesn't work we've seen it and it's pretty rich coming from a guy who claims to be so rich who hasn't paid a dime in federal incomes in  years  he says not paying taxes makes him smart well i don't know  i don't know how smart you have to be to lose a ion dollars in one year laughter and besides what kind of genius loses money running a casino for heaven's sake  
   
 actually it sounds like a few people have been at  casinos here laughter but you know this means he's contribu zero ok he actually has a gall to call our military a disaster not only is he wrong but what right does he have to say that he hasn't contribu a penny to our military not a penny to our veterans not a penny to healthcare or education not a penny to highways or infrastructure this is  this is a false  false charge that he makes about all the problems in our country and i'll tell you something we did a little research he's been denigrating ama for decades this didn't start with his birther lie against president  it didn't even start running against me back in  he took out a $ ad in the new york es criticizing president regan he said our leaders were the laughing stock of the world so this is a guy who criticizes everybody but himself and at some point you've got to say wait a minute we're better than that we are stronger than that we want to move forward forward into the future with confidence and opism and that's what we're offering in this campaign i've got to tell you it is not just what we're against that should motivate you to go to the polls it's what we are for  and i believe strongly that what we're for will make it possible for all of us and especially our kids and our grandkids to have the best future ama's best days can still be ahead of us but we can't make any of this happen if we don't have you voting now   says he can still win and he's right that's why it's so important everyone gets out and votes and here in florida  you know in a lot of places you can only vote on election day but here in florida voting couldn't be easier early voting began on monday in south florida it goes through sunday november  around the state you can go to any early voting site between  am and  pm in fact the county center on east kennedy boulevard is just a  minute walk from here  you can go vote right after this event and we'll have staff ready to help you get there and you can go to iwillvotecom to confirm your polling place and make a plan to vote but i also  you will volunteer these last two weeks  we're reaching out to everybody so go to com and sign up to volunteer take out your phone and text join  and that is  we can use you we're ma millions of phone calls in florida we're knoc on  maybe by the e we finish  millions of doors we don't want anybody to be left out or left behind because on january th ama will have a new president  now i've got to say say
   
 so i've got to say to you that you know change is inevitable in life right and so the real question is what kind of change are we going to have and i want you to talk to anybody you know who's either thin of not voting or maybe thin of voting for my opponent  no i'm serious i'm serious you know after this election if i'm fortunate enough to be elec we are going to reach out to everybody right and ask the people you're tal to what kind of change they really want because i don't think most amans want the kind of divisive and dark change   is offering mass deportations that will rip families apart a repeal of gunfree school zones on day one going back to the day when insurance companies could discriminate against us if we have a preexisting condition letting wall street write its own rules denying the science of climate change rolling back marriage equality defunding planned parenthood   the hugest tax breaks ever for the wealthy and a broad abandoning our alliances and allowing more countries to get nuclear weapons now that may be change but boy that's not the change we need and my vision is different it's more ful opistic and unifying i want us to be a country where every student can afford to go to college if that's what you choose i want us to be a country where millions of people are wor in good highpaying jobs and in new industries like clean energy and advanced manufacturing i want us to be a country where hardwor immigrants who pay taxes  and by the way onehalf of undocumen workers pay federal income taxes which means they are paying more federal income taxes than   pays  and a country where we not only have equal pay for our work but affordable childcare where we're respec in the world wor with our allies to defeat terrorism and stop the spread of nuclear weapons so yes change is coming the choice is yours about what kind of change we'll have and i  you will choose to be part of this campaign because it's not just about winning on november th as important as that is it is about getting to work because i do believe we are stronger together   and i wrote a book laying out our agenda because i think you deserve to know what i will try to do as your president so if you will help we will come together to give every aman the chance to chart your own future and contribute to our great country let's prove once and for all that love s hate thank you   presidential candidate delivers remarks with vice president   in scranton pennsylvania (sd)

 and you know i think he'd be the first to say that he cares about your families because of his family  senior and catherine taught  that all people deserve to be trea with dignity when you see someone fall you help them back up because we are all in this together that is the  way  we have seen how he fights for wor families because he passionately believes in the basic bargain that makes ama great that our economy should work for everyone not just those at the top  he stands up against injustice he has led the fight to end violence against women and girls  and he stands up for people's lives and health including the project he's now leader on behalf of president  the cancer moonshot to fund breakthroughs and save lives  as many of you know his wonderful son beau a great father a great public servant a great n being passed away last year so this is personal to   he knows it's personal to a lot of families that's why he's fighting so hard to make a difference and if i'm elec this fall i'm going to ask  to continue the important work he's begun to help us fight and defeat cancer  so as someone who has worked with  for years first in the senate then as a member of the  cabinet i can attest to that passion for standing up for people trying to make lives better it's what pushes him to work as hard as he can every second of every day for all of us and  and his wonderful wife  have raised their children and grandchildren with those e values so  i  you know how much not just scranton but ama loves you and your family so it means a great deal to have him by my side you know when  and i were deciding where to have our first campaign rally there really was only one answer scranton isn't just 's hometown it's my dad's hometown too while the 's were on north washington avenue my family the rodham's were a few blocks away on diamond avenue i was tened at the methodist church on court street my grandfather went to work at the scranton lace mill starting as a teenager it wasn't easy work but you know what i learned that business trea its workers right believe it or not the scranton lace company all those years ago actually offered a profit sharing plan and health efits at the beginning of the th century they understood something that a lot of folks have forgotten they understood that their workers were responsible for much of the businesses success so it was only fair that they shared in that success and that their families efi too and because of that job my grandfather could give my father a better life my father was able to go to college went to penn state where he played football then after he got out of penn state it was  right in the depths of the depression and he was loo for a job he heard a friend of his knew somebody who heard that somebody was hiring in chicago so he literally hopped a freight train from scranton to chicago  i don't recommend that anymore  where he got a job as a salesman he went into the navy during world war ii and when he got out he star a small business in chicago where i grew up and just like his father before him my dad was determined to give us even greater opportunities than he had and to me that is the aman dream no matter where life takes me i always remember i am the granddaughter of a factory worker and the daughter of a small business owner and i am so proud of it and you know the story of the rodhams and the s isn't unique what's unique is the country where those stories were written no matter what   says ama is great and the aman dream is big enough for everyone to share in its promise but that doesn't mean we can take it for gran and just wait until it happens to us we have a lot of work to do here in scranton you know that president  and vice president  pulled us back from the worst financial crisis since the great depression and put our economy back on a stronger footing i personally don't think they get enough credit for that under their leadership we've crea  million new private sector jobs  million people now have health care and the auto industry just had its best year ever so i think the job of the next president is to build on that but to take on the deeper challenges that emerged long before the crisis and have persis through our recovery inequality is too high wages are too low it is still too hard for too many to get ahead
 so my top priority is create an economy that works for everyone not just those at the top which is why i've set five ambitious goals to get us there first we are going to make the biggest investment in new goodpaying jobs since world war ii  second we're going to make college debtfree for all and help millions of people struggling with existing student debt  third we're going to crack down on companies that shift jobs and profits overseas  and we're going to reward companies that share profits with their employees like the scranton lace company did almost a century ago  fourth fourth
          
 thank you  fourth we're going to make sure that wall street corporation and the super rich finally pay their fair share of taxes  and fifth we're going to respond to the way aman families actually live and work today by ma childcare affordable because in today's economy there is often no parent or grandparent staying home with the kids and we're going to fight for paid family leave because somees you need to take care of your child or your spouse or sick parent and you should not lose your job for ta care of the loved ones  now you know whenever i mentioned these issues you know   always said that i'm playing the woman's card well you know what i say if that's playing the woman's card then deal me in  i really believe that together this plan will go a long way toward building a stronger fairer economy where everyone can contribute to its growth everyone can share in its rewards now by contrast what's 's plan well he laid it out last week and i'll admit even before he did i didn't think it was going to be good for wor amans but it turned out to be worse than i ever imagined laughter i know some of you may have friends up here in north eastern pennsylvania who are thin about voting for  you know  boos i know i know friends should not let friends vote for  laughter  but just in care you can have a conversation explain that   would give trillions  that's trillions with a t  in tax cuts to big corporations millionaires and wall street money managers that would explode the national debt  boos and it would lead to massive cuts in things like education and healthcare he's even called for a new tax loophole let's call it the  loophole because it would allow  to pay less than half the current tax rate on income for many of his companies a pretty sweet deal he would end up paying a rate lower than millions of middleclass families now that is assuming he pays any taxes at all because we really don't know because we haven't seen his tax return  but we do know just by loo at the data we know that the  richest taxpayers in ama would get an average tax cut of more than $ million a year from the  loophole and then of course there's the estate tax that  wants to eliminate all together now if you believe that he's as wealthy as he claims that would save the  family $ ion but it would do nothing for  percent of all the other amans in our country so yes $ ion tax cut for   percent of amans get nothing think of what we could do with those $ ion we could pay for more than  veterans to get a fouryear college degree  we could provide a year  years worth of healthcare to nearly  million kids or we could fund a years worth of federal assistance to state and law  local law enforcement so there are a lot of better ways to spend the money
 and there's one more part of 's plan that i want to mention he's now saying he wants to help people pay for child care by excluding those payments from taxation well again guess who that will help the most it will help rich people who will get  to  cents on the dollar to pay for their nannies hardwor families who can't afford childcare in the first place well get little to no real help that's why his childcare plan has been panned by experts across the political spectrum left right and center because remember right now childcare costs as much as in state college tuition in most of the country so we need real solutions that will work for wor people not just the well off and to prove that he really cares about this issue  made a point about tal about how his businesses offer on site child care to workers well that kind of perked  me up laughter because if he really did that it would be a big deal i wish more companies would provide onsite childcare that would be a huge efit for employees but like so much of what he says is not true it turns out some of his resorts hotels and clubs offer child care services but for guests not employees just saying if you stay at a  hotel you could enroll your kid in something called  kids laughter they will get special childrens room service childrens spa service even a nanny for a fee but if you work for his business if you clean the rooms water the lawns carry peoples bags you get nothing i'm not even sure  knows that providing a  kids program for paying customers is not the e thing as providing real child care for your workers just like his tax breaks for ionaires aren't the e as a real plan to help ama's wor families you know vice president  has a saying i love don't tell me what you value show me your budget and i'll tell you what you value  no it's pretty clear   wants to give trillions of tax breaks to people like himself not invest in our veterans our kids our police officers our teachers and anyone who really provides services and we have real serious challenges in ama we need serious leadership this is not a reality tv show it's as real as it gets look at what's happening in milwaukee right now we've got urgent work to do to rebuild trust between police and communities ad get back to the fundamental principle  everyone should have respect for the law and be respec by the law  so on all these important challenges you have to ask yourself is  up to the job he's giving a speech  he's giving a speech about isis today now i've laid out my strategy for defeating isis over many months we will strike their sanctuaries from the air and support local forces ta them out on the ground under president  and vice president  we are ma progress we will surge our intelligence so we detect and prevent attacks before they happen we will disrupt their efforts online to reach and radicalize young people in our country it won't be easy or quick but make no mistake we will prevail there is no doubt in my mind 
 usa usa usa
 and once again in comparison 's been all over the place on isis he talked about letting syria become a freezone for isis a major country in the middle east that could launch attacks against us and others he's talked about sending ground troops aman ground troops  well that is off the table as far as i am concerned
 so we'll wait and see what he says today but somees he says he won't tell anyone what he'll do because he wants to keep his plan quote secret and then it turns out the secret is he has no plan laughter and that was very clear when he said i know more about isis than the generals no  you don't and on top of that he says more countries should have nuclear weapons including in the middle east he talks about wal away from our european allies he has the temerity to say that the uni states military is a disaster well i wish he'd spent as much e as  and i have meeting the brave young men and women who serve in the military meeting their families meeting with gold star families those are not the words of someone who respects our military and the sacrifice that our young men and women make every single day  i said in philadelphia that a man you can bait with a tweet is not a man you can trust with nuclear weapons it's also not a man you can trust to run our economy help heal our cities or be a role model for our children there is no doubt   is temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be president of the uni states and commanderinchief  so my friends ama deserves a president who can get the job done bring our country together not tear it apart deliver real results for hardwor amans and we can't win this election without you that's why i'm as you to join right now take out your phone and text join or go to com we are hiring organizers right here in pennsylvania and across the country we are going to run a vigorous campaign across pennsylvania we're going to keep building the future that you and your families deserve and i am so sure we can do this especially with this man fighting alongside us just like he always has so scranton please let's give it up for the vicepresident of the uni states   
 hello folks it's good to be home folks let me tell you what scranton does deserve well thank you scranton deserves what it's always deserved because it is made up of so many people with grit and courage  i mean this sincerely from the bottom of my heart  with grit courage determination  who never ever give up they deserve someone who not only understands them they deserve someone who's with them and they deserve someone who's made of the e stuff that's   that's who she is  it's good to be home with so many friends as i look around as a matter of fact one of the people in the reception line said my aunt owns your house  tell her i'm coming i'm coming home i was there when i was running and up in the bedroom  written on the wall still is   slept here and then it said lived here i'm glad they added the lived here part you know i'm often asked why we moved from greenridge to claymont delaware and then wilmington
 claymont's a suburb of wilmington delaware and it's because of bob casey no look  the caseys lived five blocks from us just around the corner from st clair's and i am midway between  and  and i knew only one of us was going to make it out of greenwich and i knew it was not going to be me so i had to move there was too much casey talent in the neighborhood   you are a great friend and great uni state senator thank you  as they say in southern delaware they talk at you like this matt cartwright  that boy married up he married right up i tell you he was always see influence  but you got it man you are doing a wonderful job as well thank you  i have been home since this e but i stood here eight years ago kic off our campaign  and   at my side they always had my back i want to make it clear that as scranton has always had my back  we and fact all of us will have your back   scranton has been so some of the folks in our administration were there on election night when the results were coming in i give you my word as a  i asked one and only one question  what did we do in the northeast we won by a larger margin than we had before the rest did not matter i took full credit for it nothing to do with it you know if you listen to  you'd think i was a kid who just climbed out of a coal mine with a lunchbox from scranton i'm the kid from scranton well i am from scranton and i was a kid at one e but so often quite frankly my people in delaware resen  i've represen them for  years a us senator and  years in high public office and i swear to god  there's a parade that star on the fourth of july just as i was getting star in ' and it was called the hockessin parade it's right on the pennsylvania border and from the e my boys were then three and four years old four and five years old  actually three and four years old  they were in the parade with me and so when my beau  and he was the most popular politician in delaware  i would tag along with him no for real in the parade so one of the things i am trying to do  after the people of delaware have been so generous to me all these years and to beau as attorney general i am trying to go back and do as many things in the last year at home in delaware to show my affection and my appreciation and so i was in the fourth of july parade in hockessin recently surprising the press and everyone because i was there and there were thousands of people there many of the e people had wai five hours in line to pay respects at my son's viewing and i was there to thank them for the overwhelming support they gave me for all those years and as i continued along the parade route two guys came running up to me big guys both guys i played ball with bigger than me secret service was about to have a heart attack and they said  what in the hell is all this stuff about scranton you're from claymont god darn it you're from claymont you're from delaware still aren't you  so you all have to write a note and tell them i love scranton it's my home but you know what home is where your character is stamped where it's stamped into your soul where your values are set where your view of the world and your place in that world began for me that was  north washington avenue around my grandfather finnegan's table as where i learned that money doesn't determine your net worth that no one i mean it sincerely  this is not hyperbole this is deadly earnest  i learned that no one is more worthy than you and everyone is your equal
 i learned from my mother catherine eugenia jean finnegan  that and she said this so many es she'd look you in the eye and say y look at me remember you're defined by your courage and you're redeemed by your loyalty  she'd go on to say because everybody's had tough es she says as long as you're alive you have an obligation to strive you're not dead until you've seen the face of god what i learned here from my father is that i can be anything i wan to be that anything can be accomplished this is not a joke this is real that the measure of your character is not whether you'll get knocked and fall because you will the measure is how quickly you get up  i learned about resilience from my father who like many of you and many of your parents made what i call the longest walk the longest walk any man and woman can make is up a short flight of stairs to their child's bedroom to say honey i'm sorry we can't live here anymore we lost the house or daddy or mommy doesn't have a job i remember my dad ma that walk moving us to my grandfathers' home i remember  but what i remember most was him saying but i promise you everything everything is  you can't go back to st 's you can't play in grooves  and leave anymore but i promise you everything is going to be okay and he meant it he knew it because it used to be a basic bargain back then it used to be a bargain if you worked like hell for the outfit you worked with when they did well you got to participate how's the bargain what  is all about is ma sure that everyone of you everyone of you can look your child and their grandchild in the eye and say honey i mean this sincerely and everything is going to be okay think how many people you know who don't feel like they can say that right now my father when he said it on the balls of his heels he meant it because he thought  clear shot if you worked hard everything i learned from my father and grandfathers table was reinforced by my neighbors and my friends all around this town pride independence resiliency when i moved away from scranton i was going into the fourth grade but i never left i spent summers holidays college weekends weddings funerals first communions bar mitzvahs by the way  for me it was nay aug park it wasn't the lake  i always remember that i've been taught what you all believe up here everyone is entitled to be trea with dignity and respect no matter who they are that ama   that ama and  gets this better than anybody i know that ama can be defined in one single word possibilities that's the thing about ama  that's the thing about scranton that's the thing about who we are anything is possible that's the ama i know ladies and gentlemen that's the ama   knows  you know the people i trust most in public life i've been at this a long e  trust the people where the feeling starts in their gut moves to their heart and then is articula by a great mind  understands the s and aspirations of the people in claymont in scranton and every scranton and claymont in the uni states of ama i've known her for over  years  i knew her before she was first lady when we served together in the senate during her years as secretary of state once a week we'd have breakfast at my home i became the whisperer
 she'd look at me and say what did he mean by that  he loves her everybody knows this has never been an issue with  unlike it's a gigantic issue for her opponent but all kidding aside everybody by the way my family's right there the family good morning i didn't even see you secret service you see that beautiful young girl there make sure she gets back when i leave the stage ok because we're not leaving until i get a hug anyway sorry guys it's kind of a family thing but look think about it everybody has known from day one how smart how bright  is everybody knows how tough she is but what i don't think everybody knows enough about it may be the different between the irish catholic and the methodist piece here we wear everything on our sleeve i don't think they fully understand how passionate she is about what she does i've known i want you to listen just for a minute i don't even want you to clap i want you because i want to make sure you understand what i know about her you know she understands that that college loan to get a bright young girl or boy to school is about a lot more than whether or not they're going to get a chance it's about the pride and the dignity of the parent who looks at that child i mean it sincerely please don't just listen to this i remember i went down to my dad's place of work to pick up a car and he was wandering back and forth in the par lot the secretary said he's out there i walked out and he said y i'm so sorry i'm so damned sorry this was before cell phones i thought maybe something happened he said i went to the bank today honey they won't lend me the money to get you to school i'm so ashamed  understands that the most damaging thing to a parent is to look at a talen child or a sick child or a child in need and not be able to do anything she's understood that for years she's understood for years that millions of people here in scranton and claymont and all across ama went to bed staring at a ceiling thin my god what happens if she develops breast cancer or he gets lung cancer what happens we lose everything what do we do then a lot of you remember those days my family remembers those days she gets it she understands what it will mean and i really mean this it's more than about her she understands it means for these beautiful young girls and i'm being serious now these three beautiful little girls i'm loo at now what it will mean to them when it's president  rodham  it will change their lives it will change their lives it will prove that my daughter and my granddaughters can do anything my sons and grandsons can do that's what it will mean it's consequential so let me say this as clearly as i can if you live in a neighborhood like i grew up in or my wife  grew up in willow grove or down in claymont if you worry about your job getting decent pay if you worry about your children's education if you're ta care of an elderly parent after losing the other one then there's only one person in this election who will possibly help you and that is   folks she's always been there it's not a joke you know you use phrases like that but she has always been there that's her life story and let's state the obvious that is not  's life story
 senator  kaufman who you know very well  served with you used to be my administrative assistant for years and years graduate of the wharton school an engineer my degree  at duke he  at the wharton school the wharton school by the way isn't  doesn't have a  sign up anyway  that said the difference between a success and a genuine success  excuse me  a minimum success and a real success is someone who had nothing and makes $ million is a real success someone who inherits a million and makes $ million  no they're not a bum but they're a mere  successes  some are bums but not all  look let me tell you the part that bothers me and you know as  will point out and knows that no one ever doubts i mean what i say  the problem is i somees  say all that i mean  but let me tell you what really bothers me most and maybe this only works where i grew up i don't know but you know what bothers me most about   is his cynicism is unbounded i  i  no i really mean this think of  this for a minute  all raised in this area you're different ethnicities different religions different backgrounds but there's one thing i've noticed all the years i've sent and i've always always come home and that is that the way you were raised if you ever showed a lack of empathy for someone in trouble if you ever summed up a thought that the phrase he's most proud of you're fired  think  think about the phrase you're fired think  no all kidding aside i really mean this maybe it's just me but think about what your mother or father or grandmother or grandfather would have said to you think about everything you learned as a child i really mean this no matter where you were raised how can there be pleasure in division and you're fired and he's trying to tell us he cares about the middle class give me a break and to repeat myself is such a bunch of malarkey it makes no sense none none none none  this guy doesn't care about the middle class and i don't even blame him in a sense because he doesn't understand it he doesn't have a clue no no he really  he really doesn't he doesn't have a clue and by the way there's something else he has no clue about that has nothing to do with being a  or a  i have worked  i have worked with eight presidents of the uni states i have served with hundreds of senators only  senators in history i'm embarrassed to say have served as long as i have  dozens of secretaries of state and secretaries of defense of both parties and i can say without hesitation my word as a  no major party nominee in the history of the uni states of ama has  now don't cheer or  quiet  just listen  has known less or been less prepared to deal with our national security than   and what absolutely amazes me  what absolutely amazes me that he doesn't seem to want to learn it no i really mean it he doesn't seem to want to learn it he doesn't seem to think it matters this man is totally thoroughly unqualified to be president of the uni states of ama  he not only lacks the temperament  people say he lacks the temperament i  i'd feel better if that's all he lacked  on every issue that matters most to our security   has no clue what it takes to lead this great country now look you know if i had said this eight  months ago they'd say well you know i'm being partisan well i am partisan i make no apologies for that but i'm not mean about it and as  will tell you i don't know any  that is more positive relationships with s than i do in the uni states senate
 but having said that look at the people who've come out scores and scores of the most prominent  thinkers in the national security field they've come out and both political parties have repor that he has no idea what he's tal about even confron with the facts he doesn't want to learn them the few es he tries to deal with the facts he reveals a profound misunderstanding what's at stake just listen for a second listen to him he belittles our closest allies in this hemisphere and in europe nations that stand with us are part of our security network that are with us when we address every international challenge those who fought and bled alongside us for decades he wants to toss those relationships aside like the ones that  like his failed business ventures or something in the meane he talks cavalierly about encourage  and other nations as  poin out  to develop nuclear weapons as if nuclear war is some trivial affair does he not understand we wrote japan's constitution to say they could not be a nuclear power where was he when  in school   someone who lacks this judgment cannot be trus there's a guy that follows me right back here has the nuclear codes so god forbid anything happened the president and i had to make a decision the codes are with me all  he is not qualified to know the codes  he can't be trus  i was proud my son beau served for a year in iraq came back a highly decora soldier i must tell you  i must tell you that a   for president  i would've thrown my body in front of him no i really mean it to keep it from going if the judgment was based on 's decision every president since harry truman has looked toward a europe  whole free and at peace one of the most consequential people right now who's trying to undo that is a man that   says he admires now i'm not big on the character assassination stuff i really mean that i mean look at  look at everything any campaign i've ever run i'm just trying to like that old program of where we run just the facts ma'am nothing but the facts  oh that was  friday actually  but he says he admires   (audience boos) no no no no no it's more than  it's more than the boos here's the deal what is 's objective as   knows as well as anyone dealing with  as i have and the president has and  kerry  is determined to crack nato and crack the european alliance that is his overarching overwhelming interest i'm heading from here getting on a plane and flying to kosovo then to serbia then i'm going to the baltic states you know one of the reasons i'm going is to make sure to reassure those who remember the nato and the baltic states we mean what we say we mean what we say the sacred alliance of  years because they're worried  listen to his comments about ukraine are you sure that russia will not move on ukraine but him  without understanding they've already moved on ukraine and occupy crimea this guy's shame has no limits he's even got so far as to ask  and russia to conduct cyber attacks against the uni states of ama (audience boos) no no even if he is jo  which he's not even if he's jo what an outrageous thing to say look folks these are not isola examples he's even showered praise on saddam hussein one of the most violent dictators of the th century a man who repealy backed terror attacks against israel because he was supposedly  the reason he admires him  he was a killer of terrorists that's why he likes saddam he would've loved stalin he would've loved stalin look this  this says a lot about his approach that explains why he so often embraced tactics of terrorists enemies themselves
 religious intolerance casting entire communities as culpable for the acts of a few of the community torture when he knows it's illegal and says he would still order it even though the military commanders said they would not obey his orders when can you think of ever in history where military commanders have said before a man or woman is elec that they would not follow his orders threatening to kill innocent family members of suspects indiscriminate bombing what he calls for that's how anyone hoping to lead this great democracy in the world should behave look he likes autocrats he wills the politics of fear and intolerance calling for a ban on muslims in the uni states slandering proud muslim parents of a gold star family who paid the ulate sacrifice threatening to send aman citizens to guantanamo i tell you this guy's ok
 no no no
 look 's ideas are not only profoundly wrong they're very dangerous and they're very unaman you know they reveal a profound ignorance of our constitution it's a recipe for playing into the hands of terrorists and their propaganda last year isil's top leader who we had been trac since we got bin laden   me  everyone else the president  his name is albaghdadi  and he revealed the goal of isil he just said it straight out you can go on their website he said their goal is to quote compel the crusaders to actively destroy the gray zones themselves meaning anywhere where tians and muslims live he calls a gray zone he said the objective is to actively destroy that gray zone muslims in the west he says will have to quickly find themselves between two choices either apostatize or emigrate to the islamic state and thereby escape prosecution how does he make the case by pointing out that no muslim is welcome in the west isil wants to manufacture a clash of civilizations between us versus them  is trying to give them exactly what they want last week he stood in front of a crowd in florida and said president  founded a terrorist organization isil now look look this i really should end with you know that's an outrageous statement but let me tell you why it's a dangerous statement why  as he might say the bad guys are listening yesterday the head of hezbollah a terrorist organization iran's top terrorist surrogate and a direct threat to our ally israel repea 's claim in the entire muslim world and  i mean around the world that president  founded isil you say well what difference does that make here's exactly what the leader of hezbollah said referring to 's accusation he said this this is not just a spokesman for isil  excuse me for hezbollah this is not a simple speech referring to  this  i'm quoting him this is an aman presidential candidate this was spoken on behalf of the aman  party and he meaning  has the data and documents to back it up if my son were still in iraq  and i say to all those who are there the threat to their life has gone up a couple clicks it's gone up a couple clicks you saw what's happening in turkey where some in turkey are accusing us of being part of the coup attempt ladies and gentlemen does he have any idea the adverse consequences these outlandish comments have on our allies our friends and the physical safety of our troops  is already ma our country less safe and i'm testing your stamina so let me go to the end here he has said  hasn't forgotten more about aman foreign policies than  and his entire team will ever understand ladies and gentlemen  has been there she has been tes i have been in the room with her as we jointly have with the president's leadership sent some of these killers to the  of hell at our weekly breakfast on the international stage she is strong she's respec she's admired there is nothing that she does not understand about ama's place in the world ladies and gentlemen because she knows one thing that   does not know  it has never been a good bet to bet against the uni states of ama give it a fair shot give it a fair chance amans have never never never ever let their country down never ladies and gentlemen of scranton we never allow we never d we never kneel we never yield we own the finish line that's who we are we are ama  and she gets it we are second to none and   is going to write the next chapter in aman history    presidential candidate delivers remarks at a campaign event in philadelphia pa (sd)

 hello philadelphia  wow i  thank you thank you thank you so much i  i am so exci to be back in the city that hos the greatest convention  i  i can't tell you as i've been travelling across the country how many people have said to me how much they loved being in philadelphia  and believe it or not there  there are some people who hadn't been to philadelphia before the convention and they left loving this city and i can't thank all of you enough for all the hospitality i want to thank my longe friend congressman bob y  thanks to mayor  kenney  state senator vincent hughes state representative dwight evans councilwoman jannie blackwell city council president darrell clarke a long e friend of mine former city councilwoman marian tasco  and all those who spoke in the preprogram and to everybody gathered here it is exciting to be back and as you heard we want you all to register to vote we have places to register because we don't want you on the sidelines come november this is the most consequential election the stakes could not be higher and we want everybody in philadelphia everybody across pennsylvania to be part of a great victory in november and then  the future that we're going to build together  have any of you been watching the olympics  well i've got to tell you i am a big olympics fan i  those athletes what they give up the sacrifice the work i understand that philadelphia's own nia ali just made the first round heat in the  meter hurdles today team usa is showing the world what this country stands for  i am proud of our team there and i'm proud of the incredible teamwork that they show i was thin the other day when   speaks he speaks about fear he speaks about such negativity and such pessimism and then i watched the olympics and it's exactly the opposite you have young people going out doing their best every day to get prepared to compete and that's what we're going to do in ama
 there is nothing we can't do if we put our minds to it 
 i i was up in scranton yesterday with vice president    audio gap
 and we had a great day both  and i have in scranton so we saw a lot of people that we're rela to a lot of  audio gap
   how do you do it they see me on tv and on  tape  and i'm in another state then i'm in another state and i'm lucky i can sleep on  audio gap
   and held but what it's really all about is getting up everyday and being motiva to make sure that every person inaudible and every person in this commonwealth and every person in this country has the e chance to live up to your dreams the e opportunities that previous generations of amans enjoyed  audio gap
   educators in the audience who make dreams come true 
 because actually so i know what we can do together but how are we going to pay for it well i'll tell you how we're going to pay for it 
 we're going where the money is we're going after the super wealthy we're going after the corporations we're going after wall street so they pay their fair share  that's why i was so surprised when   came out and talked about the economy because actually he would give trillions of dollars in more tax breaks to the wealthy he wants a new tax loophole that we call the  loophole that would actually help him and everybody else who is really wealthy to cut their tax rate in half on a lot of their income he wants to eliminate the estate tax which does nothing for  percent of all amans but you know if  is as wealthy as he claims to be it would save his family $ ion i got to tell you inaudible $ ion early childhood helping our veterans helping our law enforcement do what they need to do helping more people get the job training and the skills training in fact we could hire  public school teachers for $ ion  we could actually audio gap
  health care for our veterans for $ ion and we could invest in affordable housing and small businesses for $ ion right here in pennsylvania so i think we know what we need to do the question is whether we will do it and that all comes down to who shows up and votes that's why we have been registering voters in our campaign we launched a drive to register  million voters and get those voters to commit to vote it doesn't do you any good if you're registered and you don't show up right so we've got people waving over there they've got their voter registration forms for you  and we want you to be part of this so here's what i'm as i'm as you to register yourself and i'm as you to ask everybody you know to register because when we do that we make a commitment that we care about what's gonna happen in this election 
 and we also care about winning back the senate that  ma the senate  again    and trying to pick up some more s in the house of representatives that will help too  you see i have this oldfashioned idea loo at our last two  presidents president  and    and a guy named  that we got a lot done for ama when they were in office right  you know when i hear folks criticizing president  i'm thin well what don't they like they don't like the fact that he helped save the economy from the worst financial crash since the s they don't like the fact we now have  million more people who have access to affordable health care they don't like the fact that his intervention saved the auto industry and imposed the toughest new rules on wall street what don't they like when i hear people criticize  i think what don't they like the peace or the prosperity it's kind of hard to know
 so don't be complacent my friends because even though we're doing fine right now i'm not ta anybody anywhere for gran we're going to work hard these next  days and i can't do it without your help  now we have packets for you at the door so you can also canvass meet your neighbors canvass across west philly after this event this evening we're opening our southwest philly office on nd and cedar stop by the deadline for registering is october the  so we have work to do but here's what i promise you i promise you that we're going to go not only as hard as we can to win this election but then to go as hard as we can to achieve the results that the country needs and that's why i talk specifically about what i want to do i know that some people make fun of me they say oh she has all these plans and you can go to my website and read my plans but i'll tell you  you know why i do that because i want you to know what i'm going to try to do so you can both help me and hold me accountable for doing what i told you i want to do  we want to create millions of new good jobs and infrastructure because our roads our bridges our tunnels our ports our airports are falling apart our water systems our sewer systems are falling apart and we also need a new modern electric grid to be able to take and distribute all the clean renewable energy that we're going to be producing and when people say to me we can't bring manufacturing back to the uni states i say but i've seen it i have seen what we can do i have been in plants in pennsylvania in ohio across ama who are doing just that and when i meet the people there's such pride and dignity when i was in stown wire technologies on our bus trip with   and i met people wor there i met a young marine veteran he's been there now a couple of years he is as proud as he can be because he's ma something that really makes a difference and that is expor around the world from stown pennsylvania so don't tell me we can't make things i know we can i was in a plant outside of detroit last week it used to be an autosupply plant then in   it was star in  by the grandfather of the guy who's the chair of their board now in  they star they were ma auto parts then in  their main customer one of the auto makers moved a lot of their production  now they could have been really just broken by that they could have said you know what we gotta close up shop but that's not what they did they were so determined to keep that business going so they said what skills do we have what can we do now and they got into the aerospace business 
 there i saw the nosecone of a f there i saw the parts they're ma for nasa for the rocket that will take astronauts on the manned mission to mars in  michigan a place that used to make auto parts which is now literally ma rocket parts and you know what i thought i thought wait a minute this could have been one of those sort of poor me stories you know we can't do it we can't compete but instead people got up and said yes we can and yes they did right  and i star loo at the machines that they were using a lot of precision machines made in germany made in japan made in italy i said to the workers there could we make those machines they said you bet we could if we have the right partnership between our government and manufacturing we can have a renaissance in manufacturing and jobs that will give people good livings and the pride and dignity of work and here's something we don't say often enough more than half of the jobs that are predic for  are not going to require a four year college degree so i want to make college affordable for everybody and we're going to get that done  i want to help you refinance and pay down your student debt if you already have that but i also want to make sure community college is free and we have more technical education back in our high schools i want us to have more apprenticeships so that more young people get the skills that they can use to fill those jobs in   so i am opistic and another big area where i'm opistic is green renewable energy where we're going to be the st century clean energy super power not china not germany the uni states of ama  so i know we can do this we got ourselves out of the worst financial crash we're standing now we're going to start running again and we are particularly going to focus on young people who have been left out of education and the job market and middle aged and older people who have lost jobs and need new skills to be able to compete and win again in the job market  and while we're doing that we're going to start at the very beginning with early childhood education universal prekindergarten because we are stronger together and we need all of our people to feel that they've got a shot you know even abraham  talked about how important it was  audio gap
  give every aman a fair shot in the race of life that's what we've got to get back to it's just wrong that some people do well and other people feel like they're never going to catch up so i want to be a president for not only s but s and independents too i want to be a president for the struggling the striving and the successful i want to be a president for those who vo for me and those who don't vote for me because we are all in this together
 so there's a lot we could do on the economy there's a lot we can do on education there's a lot we could do on healthcare we are going to build on the affordable care act and we're going to get the cost of premiums copays and deductibles down and we are going to tackle the high cost of prescription drugs  and we are going to do more to help people deal with mental health and addiction problems  i probably have more people tal to me about mental health and addiction than nearly anything else you know folks talk about the economy they talk about education but when it gets really personal you know i'm in a coffee shop or tal to folks on a line here and somebody takes my hand and pulls me closer what they talk to me about is mental health and addiction  and shame on us if we don't do more to help people who are suffering and families who are in pain because of that  and we are going to have a national security and foreign policy that ama can be proud of we are going to lead the world in accordance with our value in pursuance of our interests and furtherance of our security along with our friends and allies it just absolutely bewilders me when i hear   trying to talk about national security it's not just as   said it's not just he doesn't know what he's tal about that's bad enough but what he often says hurts us it sends the wrong message to friend and foe alike in the world  and we are living in a complex world one where we need steadiness where we've got to have a real sense of how we're going to get where we want to go to help as many people to keep our country safe but to do it with the kind of bigness the kind of confidence that really marks ama at our best you know somees when i hear  tal about how we should all be so afraid all the e and then i find a few minutes to watch the olympics i think my goodness you know when you go out and compete not everybody can win but you got to do your best  and can you imagine you know  phelps or simone biles or all these other great aman athletes in the locker rooms well i don't know i'm too afraid to go out and compete no they get out there they compete they do their best they demonstrate the kind of spirit that we want from all amans  and then finally i think we have to defend the advances and rights that we have made here in ama and    i am very proud of our young people this is the most tolerant and generous generation that we've ever seen in ama and yes we are going to defend n rights and civil rights and women's rights and gay rights and voter rights and worker rights 
 because if we're going to lift everybody up we need to do it in a way that lets those people feel that their dignity is respec as well and yes i am going to take on the gun lobby to try to save lives here in philadelphia and across pennsylvania 
    
 and as i  as i said here in philadelphia in my speech that doesn't mean i want to abolish the second amendment that doesn't mean that i wanna round up people's guns what that means is i wanna keep you from being shot by somebody who shouldn't have a gun in the first place  we can't let this go on we need comprehensive background checks close the gun show loophole the online loophole we need to pass a law finally that says people who are on the terrorist watch list can't buy  can't buy weapons in ama  so i'm exci about what we can do but first we gotta get there so let me thank you for being out here on a hot august afternoon at this beautiful high school  and let me ask you to be sure to register to canvass to be part of this campaign because i'm not trying to just win an election i'm trying to build a base of voters who understand that we've gotta stand up for these rights we have to work for these causes we have to be commit to these goals who will get up with me after the election and work to make sure that we actually deliver the results that we all know we need so my friends lets go to work and let's build the future that ama deserves thank you and god bless you   delivers remarks at a campaign event in cincinnati ohio

 thank you 
   
 thank you so much wow it is great to be back in cincinnati  what a beautiful night on the banks of this magnificent river i am grateful to all of you i am thrilled to be here with my dear friends mark and gabby and with all of you because there are just eight days left in what is the most important election of our lifees  are you ready to work hard in this election and win it  are you ready to send  stland to the uni states senate  you know i've known  a long e he is a champion for workers and families he knows that ohio needs more good jobs with rising wages and he is the kind of person who will actually work to get things done brea through the gridlock in washington  and this is important unlike his opponent  stland has never been afraid to stand up to    i also want to thank mayor  cranley and state representative alicia reece and all the other elec officials including my friend the secretary of state alison lundergan grimes from across the river in kentucky  and we are so fortunate to have two other champions for aman families with us today i am awed by the courage and commitment that both mark and gabby bring to their work to do everything they can to help save lives in ama  you know as gabby says everyday when she goes out fight fight fight and fight she does she fights to make sure that we save lives and we prevent injuries and we do it together to end the epidemic of gun violence that threatens our children our fellow men and women our country  and gabby and mark know something very important there is a big majority of amans  including a majority of gun owners  to stand behind and achieve common sense gun safety measures and   i am loo forward to wor with them as their partner you know you go through life you go through the campaigns there's ups and there're downs and you know my mother who had a really difficult life she told me something that has stayed with me and certainly has come in handy in this campaign everybody gets knocked down what matters is whether you get back up  and throughout this campaign i have stayed focused on one thing you your lives your families the problems that keep you up at night because that's really what this election is all about it's not about the noise and the distractions it's about what kind of country we want for our kids and what kind of president can help get us there i  i  you know i  i have so much that i want to do with you on behalf of cincinnati and ohio and ama and whether or not i get the chance to serve you really depends on what happens in this election  now earlier  earlier today  earlier today i was up at kent state  a great university  and i told them about some of the reasons why i think it's really important to get everybody out to vote in this election but i star by saying you know there's this new email story about you know why in the world the fbi   would decide to jump into an election without evidence of any wrong doing with just days to go that's a really good question but i want you to know look i've said repealy on  i  you know i made a mistake i'm not ma any excuses but i will tell you this if they want to look at some more emails of one of my staffers by all means go ahead look at them and i know they will reach the e conclusion they reached when they looked at my emails last year right  it wasn't even a close call and i think most people have moved on they're loo and focused on ok who is going to be the next president and commanderinchief  did any of you see  did any of you see the debates any of you see the debates
   
 i  i got a little bit of a chance you know i did stand there for fourandahalf hours with   proving conclusively i have the stamina to do the job  but  but i did occasionally get the chance to you know ask people to take a look at my  years of public service my plans for our country what   and i have said we want to do and then weigh that against my opponent what he's done and said i  i am running against someone who says he doesn't understand why we can't use nuclear weapons he actually said then why are we ma them he wants more countries to have nuclear weapons he's mentioned japan south korea even saudi arabia now if you are hoping that he might surround himself with good people who would stop his crazy ideas remember this when he was asked who he consults with on foreign policy   said he didn't need to consult because and i quote i have a very good brain laughter he said he knows more about isis than our generals do  no  you don't and of course the people that   has around him include two men who's activities are also reporly being investiga because of their ties to russia   and their allies so in these last days lets not get distrac from the real choice in this election   has proven himself to be temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be president and commanderinchief  i have to tell you that  it does not give me any pleasure saying that it's not a small thing i  i have watched and known a lot of the people who have run for president both s and s and look i've had my disagreements with s i might have disagreed on policies or principles but i never doub their fitness to serve in this office   is different and that's why there is so much at stake in this election he has a dark and divisive vision for ama that could tear our country apart abraham  understood a house divided against itself cannot stand and that was over the greatest of challenges the challenge posed by slavery and we fought a civil war but we also have to take stock of how divided we are today the kinds of divisions that need to be healed to bring people together i will tell you this i want to bring not just s but s and independents people who will vote for me and people who vote against me together  because i have a very different vision of ama instead of dark and divisive it's ful and inclusive it's big hear not small minded  it is about lifting people up not putting them down it's a vision that says and i believe this with all my heart we are stronger together and   ama is great because ama is good never forget that yes we have our flaws of course we're only ns but what we have done over the course of our history to keep widening the circle of opportunity and equality and freedom is unlike any other place in the history of the world so we want an ama where women are respec   where our veterans are honored   where parents and families are suppor and workers are paid fairly and we believe in an ama where marriage is a right and discrimination is wrong   an ama that leads in the world and lives up to our values where everyone counts everyone has a place and the aman dream is big enough for everybody so the choice could not be clearer and the stakes could not be higher when i was at kent state tal about the threats that   poses to our national security i was really struck it was a very big crowd and it was primarily students and you know i thought to myself well i'm not going to give a rahrah speech because i really want to talk about what this means to national security and i was introduced by a gentleman named bruce blair a former air force officer in charge of the nuclear codes and keys a launch officer and he came out for me along with more than  launch officers and basically they said we cannot support   because he should never ever be near the nuclear codes and keys  and even the prospect of an actual nuclear war doesn't seem to bother him good luck enjoy yourselves folks is what he had to stay about a potential nuclear conflict in asia i wonder if he even knows that a single  a single nuclear warhead can kill millions of people you know that is why dozens of retired nuclear launch officers took the unpreceden step in saying that   should and i quote not have his finger on the button and when it comes to handling a crisis we've seen in this campaign that   loses his cool at the slightest provocation when he's gotten a tough question from a reporter or when he's challenged in a debate or when he sees a protester at a rally when he's confron by his own words so imagine him in the oval office facing a real crisis  imagine him plunging us into a war because somebody got under his very thin skin i  you'll think about that when you cast your vote in this election think about what it takes to lead in a very complica world and in who's hands you want to put the safety of our children and grandchildren and think about the difference between electing a president who will do nothing and a president who will tackle the epidemic of gun violence in ama  you know as gabby knows so well  amans a year are killed by guns thousands more are injured it's an average of  people a day dying here in ohio more people are killed by guns than die in car crashes we have seen moviegoers gunned down in theaters little children killed in their classrooms clubgoers massacred in orlando nine faithful people murdered at bible study in charleston south carolina and we've seen far too many young africanaman men and women killed by gun violence which is now the leading cause of death for young black men  and when we think about that we think of dontre hamilton or jordan davis or trayvon  and others i've had the great honor of getting to know their mothers who have turned their grief into action and their mourning into a movement but here's what i want to say if anything else in our country were killing as many people people of good faith people who believe like we do in the nd amendment people who own guns people who go hunting people who are collectors we would say hey wait a minute this can't go on we need comprehensive background checks to close the gun show loop hole close the online loop hole  and we know here in ohio a majority of gun owners support these common sense steps to prevent gun violence because they know we can respect the nd amendment and keep our kids and communities safe at the e e and we need to keep guns out of the hands of suspec terrorists if you are too dangerous to fly you are too dangerous to buy a gun period  and look there is  there is a very clear difference   won't stand up to the gun lobby he's sold out to them in fact the gun lobby is spending more on ads to get   elec than any other group more than $ million in ohio alone and in return   has promised to repeal president 's actions to strengthen criminal background checks  says guns should be allowed in nightclubs that serve alcohol he's even said on his very first day in office he would require every school in ama to let people carry guns into our classrooms  how can anyone think our schools will be safer with more guns so i have stood up to the gun lobby for years  which is why they are running all these ads against me  and i will stand up to them as president  i will work with gabby and mark and amans for responsible solutions to pass common sense reforms because we've got to keep guns out of the wrong hands and help save lives i will also get up everyday in the white house wor my heart out for you whatever i can do to knock down barriers to empower people to get the economy wor for everybody not just those at the top that's how i was raised i was raised to believe that if you work hard  and i believe in hard work  you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead in ama  and i will never ever quit on you when i tell you i'm going to try to do something that will make a positive difference in your life i don't care what the political or other barriers are we're going to find a way over under around or through until we get it done  i've been fighting for families and underdogs my entire life and i'm not stopping now  so just remember when our opponents go low we go high  we're not going to be distrac we're not going to be knocked off course we know how much this election matters and everything all of you can do between now and the e that the polls close is going to really count now the   campaign strategy is pretty simple they've announced it their strategy is get women to stay home get young people to stay home and get people of color to stay home  it's all part of his scorched earth campaign but actually adds up to more than half of our whole population when you stop to think about it and it goes against everything we stand for so if you're as upset as i am by the campaign that he has run the things he has said insulting not just women but immigrants latinos african amans prisoners of war muslims veterans the military i mean the list goes on and on it's almost impossible to understand how somebody could run for president who seems not to like ama as much as he does  so you know the best way to stop him by showing up with the biggest turnout in history  we need more amans to vote and i think we have a chance to get more amans from all walks of life to vote because we're already seeing record turnout  million people have already vo in this election and more than  million of them are right here in ohio  there is no doubt if we vote we win so   please if you haven't vo early please do so and please get your friends and your family everybody you know to vote take people to vote with you try to help those who might have a little problem getting there make sure that everybody you know understands early voting has begun and you can go to iwillvotecom to find your nearest early voting location because make no mistake whatever issue you care about  i've only mentioned a few tonight  but whatever issue you care about is on the ballot now maybe my name and my opponents name but where we stand on these issues what we've done in the past what we have said we want to do in the future that is all on the ballot the future of our economy is at stake of our education system is at stake fighting climate change and clean renewable energy jobs are at stake  lgbt equality is at stake  equal pay for women is at stake  actually in the end the aman dream itself is at stake so i want you to think about how you'll feel on november th happy  i think that's the right answer  but just suppose  just suppose you go to bed early  suppose you go to bed early maybe you were too busy to vote or maybe you didn't make calls or knocked on doors i want you to imagine so you get up early on the morning of the th and you log on to news to find out hey what's going on or maybe you turn on the tv or the radio and you hear  i want you to really understand what that means for you and for all of us because i prefer for us to be motiva by what we're for not what we're against  but i also think it's prudent to imagine what could happen if we don't do our part and when in the future somebody asks you maybe your kids or your grandkids what did you do when everything was on the line i want you to be able to say i vo for a better fairer stronger ama  let's go out and in these next eight days do everything we can to make it clear we're going after the kind of future that includes everybody we're going to build this economy new jobs rising rages we're going to make college affordable and help you pay down your student debt we are going to do what will give you the best chance for your own lives and the lives of our kids and our grandkids so if we build that future together we will be able to say we were part of ma sure that ama's best days are still ahead of us  and we will prove once and for all that love s hate thank you all   presidential candidate delivers remarks at a campaign event raleigh north carolina

 thank you all  thank you  thank you  well i've got to tell you this is sure worth staying up for  it is so great to be here in raleigh here at north carolina state  and i cannot imagine a better way of ending this campaign than having the opportunity to see all of you and to watch and listen to lady gaga  one of the most inventive creative and passionate performers whose range goes from a to z and beyond and i was watching on the screen not only her perform but all of you jumping and singing and waving it was great  because you know what that's what i want for ama and the young people of ama  the joy the passion the  and you know our longterm friend jon bon jovi was with us  he was with us up in philadelphia where he and bruce springsteen sang  and jon said well hey i want to go down to raleigh and so here he is  and you know between now and the e the poll closes tomorrow we are going to be living on a prayer  i was really impressed when everybody's hand went up saying you'd already vo well go find somebody else who hasn't vo ok  bring out your friends your roommates strangers on the street laughter just stop and talk to them about what's at stake in this election because north carolina is key and it's not only important for our election are you ready to elect roy cooper as your next governor  well i sure  so i sure  so and i  you're ready to elect linda coleman your lieutenant governor  and how about dan blue iii for state treasurer  and i really really  you will send deborah ross to washington  now we are all fired up when we were with the president and  in philadelphia   you know the president was tal about how absolutely consequential this election is and of course it is i  i really believe it's the most important election of our lifees because we've never had a clearer choice never  it is a choice between division or unity between strong steady leadership or a loose cannon who could risk everything  it's a choice between an economy that works for everyone not just those at the top and it   it is a choice that really goes to the heart of who we are as amans what i saw before i came in and what i see now is a sense of potential of joy there is no reason my friends why ama's best days are not ahead of us if we   reach for them together  we don't have to accept a dark and divisive vision for ama tomorrow you can vote for a ful inclusive bighear ama  our core values  our core values are being tes in this election but my faith in our future has never been stronger i love our country and i believe in the aman people and i know if we bring everyone together we can set goals and we can move toward them and we can feel that sense of accomplishment that comes with being part of something bigger than ourselves  you know one of the  one of the great privileges of crisscrossing the country as i have in this campaign is meeting remarkable people people who stand up against the odds people who like my late mother people who understand that everybody gets knocked down what matters is whether you get back up whether you believe you can keep going  last night in manchester new hampshire i had the honor of being introduced by an extraordinary man khizr khan who's son captain khan was killed serving our country in iraq  you may remember mr khan's speech at the  convention and  again last night he reminded us of the responsibility we all share to protect and defend our constitution the story of captain khan is one of courage in the face of danger he was with his unit when he saw a suspicious vehicle he told his men to stay back he moved toward the vehicle to check it out and the bomb went off he lost his life but everyone else in his unit survived he was awarded the bronze star  and this intensely personal tragedy that the khan family experiences becoming a gold star family was one that they thought about grieved over in the privacy of their home until they heard my opponent start tal about who was acceptable in ama and who wasn't the categories of people starting with immigrants including africanamans and latinos and pows and muslims the list went on and on and it crea in mr khan a sense of despair because he asked himself would his son have a place in  's ama someone who paid the ulate price in serving our country well we can answer that question tomorrow resoundingly yes absolutely  think about  think about how generations of amans throughout our history have come together to meet the tests of their e our parents our grandparents our greatgrandparents defended democracy they built the great aman middle class they marched for civil rights and voting rights for workers' rights and women's rights for inaudible and the rights of people with disabilities and tomorrow we face the test of our e so remember it's not just my name or  's name on the ballot it's the kind of country we want it's every issue anyone cares about so if you believe ama thrives when the middle class thrives then you have to vote tomorrow if you believe we should make the biggest investment in new jobs since world war ii in infrastructure advanced manufacturing clean energy small business then you have to vote  if you believe we need more fairness in our economy to raise the minimum wage because no one who works fulle should still be in poverty then you have to vote if you believe we need to do more to support wor families with affordable child care paid leave and equal pay for women then you have to vote  and remember when my opponent says every e i talk about these issues that i'm playing the woman's card well you know what i say deal me in  and if you believe  if you believe all kids deserve good schools with good teachers no matter what zip code they live in you have to vote and if you believe college should be more affordable you have to vote    and i worked on a plan to make public colleges and universities tuitionfree   if you earn less than $ and debtfree for everybody else  and for the millions of amans struggling with student debt we are going to help you pay that down and pay that off  if you believe in science and that we've got to address climate change you have to vote  if you believe we need to reform our criminal justice system so   then you have to vote and if you believe  if you believe we should never write discrimination into our laws   well then you know  you know north carolina you've got to vote to get rid of hb  now this is so energizing we could  we could keep going with a long list  but here's what  here's what else i want you to know good thing this election didn't land during exams that's all i can say  look tomorrow  tomorrow night this election will end but i want you to understand our work together will be just beginning  we have to bridge the divides in this country as the bible says we have to repair the breaches we've got to be willing to start listening to each other again respecting each other again  and i  i want to thank gaga because she has always stood for that fundamental principle of respecting  so i want you to know and i want you to spread the word i do want to be president for all amans not just some not just the people who support me and vote for me i want to be president for everyone because we all have a role to play in building that better future for our country and for each of you  so if you haven't

thank you thanks so much god bless you thank you all   presidential candidate delivers remarks at a campaign event in cleveland ohio (sd)

 hello  thank you  thank you so much wow oh i  i am so happy to be here it is great being in cleveland thank you all  i want to thank kim bratak  a teacher right here at  marshall for introducing me  and i want to thank all the teachers and educators the staff and the students of  marshall  i am deligh to be here with your mayor mayor frank jackson  also with my longe friend your former governor candidate for the senate  stland  with your county executive county executive budish i know is here somewhere  and with my great friend who did an excellent job presiding over the  national convention congresswoman marcia fudge  i always love being here and today is particularly special because i got a tour of this high school  and i first of all want to thank the people of cleveland for investing in a high school that is really all about the future  what a stark contrast this high school poses to what happened here in cleveland during the  convention because honestly they pain such a bleak negative picture of ama i couldn't recognize our country listening to their angry speeches the kind of negative view that they had of our people   saying we never win anymore well tell that to the cavaliers  tell that to our olympic athletes who are cleaning up in rio  there is nothing we can't do if we put our minds to it and that's how i want ama to feel about itself and how i want every aman to feel and i saw the future  the students and teachers who showed me what they're doing here in robotics in d design in laser design in entrepreneurial and civic education i for one am really proud of this high school and what it represents for the students here  and why is that so important for those of us who are no longer in high school because we've got to get the economy wor for everybody not just those at the top and how are we going to do that well i know that too many families right here in ohio are feeling a lot of financial stress worrying about they're going to make ends meet dealing with all the costs from childcare to prescription drugs i understand that
 that's why i have laid out specific plans about how we're going to get the economy wor for everyone and i think it's important when someone comes to you and asks for your support running for president that maybe they tell you what they want to do so that you can decide who you want to vote for  and somees you know i get criticized for doing that people say oh there she goes she has another plan laughter well i do i've got an infrastructure plan to create millions of jobs fixing our roads our bridges our tunnels our ports our airports our water systems our sewer systems  as part of that plan i want to start a national infrastructure bank so that we have public and private funds wor together so we don't just wait on congress to act but we are building rebuilding maintaining all the e and it's not just what we can see as important as that is we need a new modern electric grid that can take and distribute clean renewable energy across ama  and we need to finally finish the job of connecting every home and business everywhere in ama from inner cities to remote rural areas to highspeed broadband access so they can be a part of the st century digital economy  you know i was tal to a group of my friends who are teachers i love teachers thank you all for being here with me  and they were telling me that there had just been a national survey done and the teachers were asked do you ever  you know do you ever assign homework that requires your students to go on the internet and the answer was  percent yes they did now that makes perfect sense if you just saw what i saw you gotta have knowledge of the internet you've got to be able to learn to use it it can spark your imagination create new dreams i met young people i said well what got you interes in computer design d design robots well they were interes in the arts they were interes in what they could do to design and make things so the answer was  percent of teachers but here's the problem  million students   million homes with students in them in ama do not have access to the internet and so we're already creating a big gap  a homework gap which turns into an achievement gap and doesn't give every kid the chance to go as far as his or her hard work and talent will take them so when i talk about infrastructure i'm tal about ma our economy more competitive and creating more opportunities for more amans willing to work for it because i believe in the basic bargain if you're willing to work you ought to be able to get ahead and stay ahead that's how i was raised and that's what i want amans to believe again  you know this past monday i was in scranton pennsylvania with    and  was born in scranton my grandparents my father was born in scranton i went back to scranton every summer lot of tmas holidays my grandfather was an immigrant came as a young child he worked in the scranton lace factory ma lace which was a big deal back in those days i remember we used to have lace curtains and lace tablecloths and things like thatlaughter
 and my grandfather worked really hard because he believed that if he worked hard he could provide a better life for his kids and he did my dad got to go to college he went to penn state where he played football and  and he took a job in the midwest as a salesman and then went into the navy during world war ii when he came out he star a small business and he worked really hard and i used to go help him somees because he prin fabric for draperies and he had a print plant and he had two long tables and it was you know not a  it was just an old plant  it was low ceiling no windows and he would print that drapery fabric he'd take an old fashioned silk screen and he'd put it down and he'd pour the paint in then take a squeegee and then go from one side to another pick up the screen keep going down the table and he provided a good life i grew up in a suburb of chicago and so i know what the aman dream is all about i am proud to be the granddaughter of a factory worker and the daughter of a small businessman and standing here before you  and so when i think about how hard my dad worked and i think about him printing those fabrics and then loading them into his car and delivering them to whoever ordered them and then expecting to be paid because he had done the work it just really hits me personally when people are standing up and telling their stories they were smallbusiness people they were plumbers electricians painters who did work for   and he refused to pay them that violates the basic bargain if you do your job you're supposed to be rewarded for your work not stiffed not told to go sue somebody  and i can't help but take it personally because i think about what would have happened to my family if my father had taken a job like that and put his heart and soul into it bought the material bought the paint did the labor shows up delivers the product and is told we're not paying you but person after person small business after small business is telling the e story that they were not paid they were told to go sue   now you're a small business you can't afford lawyers to go sue somebody that's not the way it's supposed to work so when i talk about creating new jobs in infrastructure advanced manufacturing clean renewable energy i also talk about creating more small businesses and small businesses that will actually grow and give more people a chance to fulfill their dreams and will be part of the basic bargain who will be paid for the work that they do so they can stay in business  now i got to tell you creating the jobs of the future means we've got to make sure that all amans not just young amans have all the education and all the skills that are needed that's why i want to start with early childhood education so that more young kids get prepared to succeed in school  i want to see more technical education like i saw right here in  marshall across ama so that high school students can be better prepared you know when we stopped doing vocational education some years ago we basically sent a message to so many young people there's only one way to be successful in ama you've got to go to a four year college
 that is so unfair and it's also untrue  actually if you look at job projections more than half of the jobs that will be available in ama in  will not require a fouryear college degree and so how are we going to get our people prepared we're going to bring more technical education not the old fashioned kind but what i saw here at  marshall we're going to bring computer coding like i saw in a classroom just a few minutes ago we're going to bring engineering and design work we're going to give young kids in high school the chance to either get that education right in their own school or go to a community college that will provide it and give them credit to get them credentials an associate degree or credit to go on to a four year college so we're going to be more on apprenticeship programs  i want everybody who's willing to work to be prepared i don't want any excuses i'm a kind of no excuse person if you are willing to do the work i want to make sure we've got an economy that will produce the jobs and then i want to make fouryear college affordable if you go to a fouryear public college or university it should be affordable and we're going to make community college free for everybody that wants to go to community college and we're going help everybody with student debt pay down the debt get it off their backs now i think  i think it's fair to say ok how are you going to do all that that's fair to ask well we're going to do it in two ways number one we are going to tax the wealthy who have made all of the income gains in the last  years  the super wealthy corporations wall street they're going to have to invest in education in skills training in infrastructure because we have to grow this economy we do need to have the resources to do that and i've laid out what i want to do and how i would do it closing the loopholes creating a fairer tax system but i've made very clear i'm the only candidate who ran in either of the  or the  primary who said from the very beginning i will not raise taxes on the middle class the middle class has to catch up to they were before the great recession  and so i've laid this all out and so independent analysts economists and others are loo at what i've said and what   has said and in fact according to an independent analysis by moody's analytics carried out by the man who was  mccain's economic adviser  if you were to implement what i am proposing we would create at least  million new jobs in the first term of my administration  by contrast if you look at what  is proposing and how he wants to give huge tax breaks to people who are wealthy like him it would cost our economy  million jobs now this is not me saying it this is an independent analysis saying it that has tried to look at this very objectively but what does that mean for ohio
 if we divide across the country by population ohio would gain  jobs under my plans and lose more than  jobs under  's plans  and it's hard  it's not hard to see why because he wants to give tax cuts to big corporations millionaires wall street money managers he's even crea a new tax loophole that we call the  loophole because it's really good for  laughter it would let millionaires and ionaires cut their tax rate in half on a lot of their income under his plans   would pay a lower tax rate than middleclass families of course we have no idea what tax rate he pays because unlike everybody else who's run for president in the last four or five decades he refuses to release his tax returns so the aman people can't really judge  and then there's the estate tax which he wants to eliminate altogether so if you believe   is as wealthy as he claims  we can't say that for sure but let's assume it  he would  by eliminating the estate tax  save the  family $ ion and do absolutely nothing for  percent of all amans now think about what we could do with $ ion in ohio we could build  new elementary schools we could eliminate the outstanding student loan of  ohioans  we could provide health care to  veterans  and we could sure rebuild every crumbling bridge in this state and fix a lot of the highways that are causing folks to incur expenses    doesn't need a tax cut i don't need a tax cut it's e for the wealthiest amans whoever you are as well as corporations and wall street to pay your fair share in taxes you have been successful in this country because of everything this country represents we're going to stop giving tax breaks to corporations that out source jobs and profits we're going to reward those who invest in their employees again if corporations move their headquarters overseas we're going to slap an exit tax on them and try to persuade them not to move  we're going to add a new tax on multimillionaires crack down on tax gaming and close loopholes and then use that money to make the kind of investments that will grow the economy for everybody so here  here's the bottom line there are just  days left in this election i keep track of them cross them off laughter and for anyone waiting for   to suddenly become more responsible laughter  remember what a great aman maya angelou said when someone shows you who they are believe them
 and i  i think it's fair to say that   has shown us who he is he can hire and fire anybody he wants from his campaign they can make him read new words from a teleprompter laughter but he is still the e man who insults gold star families demeans women mocks people with disabilities and thinks he knows more about isis than our generals  there is no new   this is it and you know i  you will talk to any of your friends who are flirting with the idea of voting for   friends don't let friends vote for   so now  now here's what i have to ask all of you i'm proud that we have run a campaign of issues not insults that's what i'm going to continue to do for the next  days because i think the details actually matter that's why i sweat the details you know i  i really care a lot about what happens to the young people and the families and our seniors that's why i'm going to do everything i can to raise the national minimum wage so that it is a living wage  i'm going to do everything i can to make sure that you have the health care you need at an affordable price  and get the costs of prescription drugs down because they are once again getting out of reach i was at an event the other day and a very distinguished doctor the head of a big hospital in new york he said we've got to do something about prescription drug costs this is not a  not a patient or a family this is one of the most distinguished doctors in new york city he said it's getting to the point where i can't prescribe certain drugs that my patients need because the insurance won't pay for them medicare medicaid  nobody will pay for them because they are too expensive and he mentioned particularly a drug by gilead that will cure hepatitis c and it is so expensive that a lot of amans are being left out and you know what really is upsetting about this is that drug company sells that e drug all over the world at a much lower price to everybody else now i'm proud  i'm proud that our drug companies invent drugs to cure really terrible diseases and treat chronic diseases i'm proud of that but let's be clear your tax dollars help support the research that is used to create those drugs in the first place  your tax dollars support the food and drug administration that tests those drugs to determine whether or not they are safe and effective to be able to go to market and then we end up in ama paying the highest price for those drugs that we have helped to create we have got to take this on and we can do it without hurting research and discovery and new drugs and new devices
 and there are two other issues that i want to mention respecting health because i've been on the campaign trail now for  well about a year and a half ever since april of  so i have talked with and mostly listened to thousands of amans now people talk to me about their jobs they talk to me about education they talk to me about student loans and the high costs of college they talk to me a lot about gun violence they talk to me a lot about the things that are on their minds but the most emotional encounters i have are when families grab my hand and talk to me about mental health and addition  we have got to do a better job we have too many families and too many individual amans whose lives are being either totally undermined or shortened because of mental health and because of addiction so i'm going to work on those things too as your president because we've got to tackle these two problems  and i also want to defend the rights that amans now have from all of the various attacks that people are waging that's why i  i support n rights and civil rights i support women's rights  and yes i will defend planned parenthood against all of these partisan attacks  i support gay rights  voting rights which are under attack across ama including right here in ohio  i support worker's rights the right to form and organize a union and bargain collectively  i support the rights of people with disabilities who deserve more chances to be integra into the economy and society  and yes i will take on the gun lobby and try to get common sense gun safety measures passed  and know  i know  i know how difficult this is but here is what i want to say i want to say what i said at the convention in my speech i am not at all advocating the repeal of the second amendment i am not at all advocating any program that would in any way take people's guns away here is what i'm advocating i want to help you stay alive so that nobody who shouldn't have a gun in the first place gets one and hurts you or other people  because when i think about the three big challenges the next president faces getting the economy to work for everybody not just those at the top keeping us safe and leading the world with steadiness and unifying ama it's not just the job for the president we all have to do our part  and when it comes to keeping amans safe i want to keep you safe in your own communities and your homes from gun violence i want to keep us safe from terrorists no matter where they are from or what they are after
 i want to make sure that we keep our alliances strong because i know how important it is that we work together to defeat the terrorist threat and i will bring all the experience i had as a senator serving on the armed services comee as a secretary of state to make sure that ama remains the most free the most safe the most important leader in the world  but i also want to unify our country you know i bet if we had the e we'd find something that every single one of us disagreed about with everybody else we have different experiences different backgrounds i think that's part of the aman dna you know our founders had some big arguments we have a lot of impassioned people who care about the future of our country and what we should do  but at the end of the argument we've got to come together we are the greatest example of freedom and opportunity and justice that the world has ever known and we can't do anything that ever undermines that and that's why it is so important that we seek and find common ground together i did that as a first lady i worked with s to create the children's health insurance program that now covers  million kids  i worked with s to reform the adoption and foster care system which i care deeply about  i worked with s after / to rebuild new york and to make our country safer to get health care to national guard men and women i worked with every  i served with just about i worked with s as secretary of state we got a new treaty with russia to lower the number of nuclear weapons and that took  votes and we had to get s as well as s to agree with that  i happen to believe i don't have all the answers i happen to believe we are stronger together in charting a course toward the future  so i need your help stronger together is not just a slogan for our campaign it is what i believe in my heart i will get up everyday in the white house trying to figure out how we're going to create more jobs more opportunity keep us safe unify us and that's where you come in i  you will join this campaign you can do so today by texting join join at  or you can go to  com we're hiring organizers in ohio so if your interes in wor as an organizer see one of our people who will be at the doors as you leave if this a consequential election i understand a lot of the concerns that many amans have wondering and worrying about our country about their lives about their kids lives about their retirement about the purpose and dignity of their work so i know we've got challenges that we have to address but i am absolutely sure we can do this i believe ama's best days are still ahead of us  if you will join this campaign join our cause together we will not just win an election but chart a course of confidence and opism getting results for the aman people come join me please thank you all very much   delivers remarks at the   national convention

 thank you thank you so much  thank you thank you all so much 
 thank you thank you  thank you all very very much thank you for that amazing welcome thank you all for the great convention that we've had  and  thank you i am so proud to be your mother and so proud of the woman you've become thank you for bringing mark into our family and charlotte and aidan into the world and  that conversation we star in the law library  years ago  it is still going strong
   
 you know that conversation has las through good es that filled us with joy and hard es that tes us and i've even gotten a few words in along the way  on tuesday night i was so happy to see that my explainer in chief is still on the job i'm also grateful to the rest of my family and to the friends of a lifee to all of you whose hard work brought us here tonight and to those of you who joined this campaign this week thank you what a remarkable week it's been  we heard the man from    and the man of     ama is stronger because of president 's leadership and i'm better because of his friendship  we heard from our terrific vice president the one and only    he spoke from his big heart about our party's commitment to wor people as only he can do and first lady   reminded us  that our children are watching and the president we elect is going to be their president too and for those of you out there who are just getting to know    you will soon understand why the people of virginia keep promoting him from city council and mayor to governor and now senator and he will make our whole country proud as our vice president  and i want to thank     your campaign inspired millions of amans particularly the young people who threw their hearts and souls into our primary  you've put economic and social justice issues front and center where they belong  and to all of your supporters here and around the country i want you to know i've heard you your cause is our cause  our country needs your ideas energy and passion that is the only way we can turn our progressive platform into real change for ama  we wrote it together now let's go out and make it happen together  my friends we've come to philadelphia the birthplace of our nation because what happened in this city  years ago still has something to teach us today we all know the story but we usually focus on how it turned out and not enough on how close that story came to never being written at all when representatives from  unruly colonies met just down the road from here some wan to stick with the  and some wan to stick it to the  laughter the revolution hung in the balance and somehow they began listening to each other compromising finding common purpose and by the e they left philadelphia they had begun to see themselves as one nation that's what made it possible to stand up to a  that took courage they had courage our founders embraced the enduring truth that we are stronger together  now ama is once again at a moment of reckoning powerful forces are threatening to pull us apart bonds of trust and respect are fraying and just as with our founders there are no guarantees it truly is up to us we have to decide whether we will all work together so we can all rise together  our country's motto is e pluribus unum out of many we are one will we stay true to that motto well we heard  's answer last week at his convention he wants to divide us from the rest of the world and from each other he's betting that the perils of today's world will blind us to its unlimi promise he's taken the  party a long way from morning in ama to midnight in ama he wants us to fear the future and fear each other well you know a great  president franklin delano roosevelt came up with the perfect rebuke to  more than  years ago during a much more perilous e the only thing we have to fear is fear itself  now we are cleareyed about what our country is up against but we are not afraid we will rise to the challenge just as we always have we will not build a wall instead we will build an economy where everyone who wants a good job can get one  and we'll build a path to citizenship for millions of immigrants who are already contributing to our economy  we will not ban a religion we will work with all amans and our allies to fight and defeat terrorism 
 yet we know there is a lot to do too many people haven't had a pay raise since the crash there's too much inequality too little social mobility too much paralysis in washington too many threats at home and abroad but just look for a minute at the strengths we bring as amans to meet these challenges we have the most dynamic and diverse people in the world  we have the most tolerant and generous young people we've ever had  we have the most powerful military the most innovative entrepreneurs the most enduring values freedom and equality justice and opportunity we should be so proud that those words are associa with us
   
 i have to tell you as your secretary of state i went to  countries when people hear those words they hear ama  so don't let anyone tell you that our country is weak we're not don't let anyone tell you we don't have what it takes we do and most of all don't believe anyone who says i alone can fix it  yes those were actually  's words in cleveland and they should set off alarm bells for all of us really i alone can fix it isn't he forgetting troops on the front lines police officers and firefighters who run toward danger doctors and nurses who care for us teachers who change lives entrepreneurs who see possibilities in every problem mothers who lost children to violence and are building a movement to keep other kids safe he's forgetting every last one of us amans don't say i alone can fix it we say we'll fix it together  and remember remember our founders fought a revolution and wrote a constitution so ama would never be a nation where one person had all the power   years later we still put our faith in each other look at what happened in dallas after the assassinations of five brave police officers police chief  brown asked the community to support his force maybe even join them and you know how the community responded nearly  people applied in just  days  that's how amans answer when the call for help goes out twenty years ago i wrote a book called it takes a village and a lot of people looked at the title and asked what the heck do you mean by that this is what i mean none of us can raise a family build a business heal a community or lift a country totally alone  ama needs every one of us to lend our energy our talents our ambition to ma our nation better and stronger i believe that with all my heart that's why stronger together is not just a lesson from our history it's not just a slogan for our campaign it's a guiding principle for the country we've always been and the future we're going to build a country where the economy works for everyone not just those at the top  where you can get a good job and send your kids to a good school no matter what zip code you live in a country where all our children can dream and those dreams are within reach where families are strong communities are safe and yes where love s hate  that's the country we're fighting for that's the future we're wor toward and so my friends it is with humility determination and boundless confidence in ama's promise that i accept your nomination for president of the uni states  now somees  somees  the people at this podium are new to the national stage as you know i'm not one of those people i've been your first lady served eight years as a senator from the great state of new york  then i represen all of you as secretary of state 
 but my job titles only tell you what i've done they don't tell you why the truth is through all these years of public service the service part has always come easier to me than the public part i get it that some people just don't know what to make of me laughter so let me tell you the family i'm from well no one had their name on big buildings my family were builders of a different kind builders in the way most aman families are they used whatever tools they had whatever god gave them and whatever life in ama provided and built better lives and better futures for their kids my grandfather worked in the e scranton lace mill for  years  because he believed that if he gave everything he had his children would have a better life than he did and he was right my dad hugh made it to college he played football at penn state and enlis in the navy after pearl harbor when the war was over he star his own small business printing fabric for draperies i remember watching him stand for hours over silkscreens he wan to give my brothers and me opportunities he never had and he did my mother dorothy was abandoned by her parents as a young girl she ended up on her own at  wor as a housemaid she was saved by the kindness of others her firstgrade teacher saw she had nothing to eat at lunch and brought extra food to share the entire year the lessons she passed on to me years later stuck with me no one gets through life alone we have to look out for each other and lift each other up and she made sure i learned the words from our methodist faith do all the good you can for all the people you can in all the ways you can as long as ever you can  so i went to work for the children's defense fund going doorto door in new bedford massachusetts  on behalf of children with disabilities who were denied the chance to go to school i remember meeting a young girl in a wheelchair on the small back porch of her house she told me how badly she wan to go to school it just didn't seem possible in those days and i couldn't stop thin of my mother and what she'd gone through as a child it became clear to me that simply caring is not enough to drive real progress you have to change both hearts and laws you need both understanding and action  so we gathered facts we built a coalition and our work helped convince congress to ensure access to education for all students with disabilities it's a big idea isn't it every kid with a disability has the right to go to school  but how how do you make an idea like that real you do it step by step year by year somees even door by door my heart just swelled when i saw anastasia somoza representing millions of young people on this stage  because we changed our law to make sure she got an education so it's true i sweat the details of policy whether we're tal about the exact level of lead in the drin water in flint michigan the number of mental health facilities in iowa or the cost of your prescription drugs  because it's not just a detail if it's your kid if it's your family it's a big deal and it should be a big deal to you president too  after the four days of this convention you've seen some of the people who have inspired me people who let me into their lives and became a part of mine people like  moore and lauren manning they told their stories tuesday night i first met  as a year old he was wearing a fullbody brace that must have weighed  pounds because i leaned over to lift him up children like  kept me going when our plan for universal health care failed and kept me wor with leaders of both parties to help create the children's health insurance program that covers  million kids in our country  lauren manning who stood here with such grace and power was gravely injured on / it was the thought of her and debbie st  who you saw in the movie and  dolan and  sweeney and all the vics and survivors that kept me wor as hard as i could in the senate on behalf of / families and our first responders who got sick from their e at ground zero i was thin of lauren debbie and all the others  years later in the white house situation room when president  made the courageous decision that finally brought oa bin laden to justice  and in this campaign i've met many more people who motivate me to keep fighting for change and with your help i will carry all of your voices and stories with me to the white house  and you heard from s and independents who are supporting our campaign well i will be a president for s s independents for the struggling the striving the successful for all those who vote for me and for those who don't for all amans together  tonight we've reached a milestone in our nation's march toward a more perfect union the first e that a major party has nomina a woman for president  standing here as my mother's daughter and my daughter's mother i'm so happy this day has come i'm happy for grandmothers and little girls and everyone in between i'm happy for boys and men because when any barrier falls in ama it clears the way for everyone after all when there are no ceilings the sky's the limit  so let's keep going let's keep going until every one of the  million women and girls across ama has the opportunity she deserves to have
 but even more important than the history we make tonight is the history we will write together in the years ahead let's begin with what we're going to do to help wor people in our country get ahead and stay ahead now i don't think president  and vice president  get the credit they deserve for saving us from the worst economic crisis of our lifees  our economy is so much stronger than when they took office nearly  million new private sector jobs  million more amans with health insurance and an auto industry that just had its best year ever  now that's real progress but none of us can be satisfied with the status quo not by a long shot we're still facing deepsea problems that developed long before the recession and have stayed with us through the recovery i've gone around the country tal to wor families and i've heard from many who feel like the economy sure isn't wor for them some of you are frustra even furious and you know what you're right it's not yet wor the way it should amans are willing to work and work hard but right now an awful lot of people feel there is less and less respect for the work they do and less respect for them period s we are the party of wor people  but we haven't done a good enough job showing we get what you're going through and we're going to do something to help so tonight i want to tell you how we will empower amans to live better lives my primary mission as president will be to create more opportunity and more good jobs with rising wages right here in the uni states  from my first day in office to my last especially in places that for too long have been left out and left behind from our inner cities to our small towns from indian country to coal country  from communities ravaged by addiction to regions hollowed out by plant closures and here's what i believe i believe ama thrives when the middle class thrives i believe our economy isn't wor the way it should because our democracy isn't wor the way it should  that's why we need to appoint supreme court justices who will get money out of politics and expand voting rights not restrict them  and if necessary we will pass a constitutional amendment to overturn citizens uni  i believe aman corporations that have gotten so much from our country should be just as patriotic in return many of them are but too many aren't it's wrong to take tax breaks with one hand and give out pink slips with the other  and i believe wall street can never ever be allowed to wreck main street again  and i believe in science  i believe climate change is real and that we can save our planet while creating millions of goodpaying cleanenergy jobs  i believe that when we have millions of hardwor immigrants contributing to our economy it would be selfdefeating and inne to try to kick them out  comprehensive immigration reform will grow our economy and keep families together and it's the right thing to do  so whatever party you belong to or if you belong to no party at all if you share these beliefs this is your campaign  if you believe that companies should share profits not pad executive bonuses join us  if you believe the minimum wage should be a living wage and no one wor full e should have to raise their children in poverty join us  if you believe that every man woman and child in ama has the right to affordable health care join us  if you believe that we should say no to unfair trade deals that we should stand up to china that we should support our steelworkers and autoworkers and homegrown manufacturers then join us  if you believe we should expand social security and protect a woman's right to make her own health care decisions then join us  and yes yes if you believe that your wor mother wife sister or daughter deserves equal pay join us  that's how we're going to make sure this economy works for everyone not just those at the top now you didn't hear any of this did you from   at his convention he spoke for odd minutes and i do mean odd laughter  and he offered zero solutions but we already know he doesn't believe these things no wonder he doesn't like tal about his plans you might have noticed i love tal about mine  in my first  days we will work with both parties to pass the biggest investment in new goodpaying jobs since world war ii  jobs in manufacturing clean energy technology and innovation small business and infrastructure if we invest in infrastructure now we'll not only create jobs today but lay the foundation for the jobs of the future and we will also transform the way we prepare our young people for those jobs   and i will work together to make college tuition free for the middle class and debt free for all  we will also liberate millions of people who already have student debt  it's just not right that   can ignore his debts and students and families can't refinance their debts  and something we don't say often enough sure college is crucial but a fouryear degree should not be the only path to a good job  we will help more people learn a skill or practice a trade and make a good living doing it  we will give small businesses like my dad's a boost make it easier to get credit way too many dreams die in the par lots of banks in ama if you can dream it you should be able to build it  and we will help you balance family and work and you know what if fighting for affordable child care and paid family leave is playing the woman card then deal me in  now here's the other thing now we're not only going to make all of these investments we're going to pay for every single one of them and here's how wall street corporations and the super rich are going to start paying their fair share of taxes
 this is not because we resent success but when more than  percent of the gains have gone to the top  percent that's where the money is and we are going to follow the money  and if companies take tax breaks and then ship jobs overseas we'll make them pay us back and we'll put that money to work where it belongs creating jobs here at home  now i imagine that some of you are sitting at home thin well that all sounds pretty good but how are you going to get it done how are you going to break through the gridlock in washington well look at my record i've worked across the aisle to pass laws and treaties and to launch new programs that help millions of people and if you give me the chance that's exactly what i'll do as president  but then i also imagine people are thin out there but  he's a businessman he must know something about the economy  jeers well let's take a closer look shall we in atlantic city  miles from here you will find contractors and small businesses who lost everything because   refused to pay his s  jeers now remember what the president said last night don't boo vote  but think of this people who did the work and needed the money not because he couldn't pay them but because he wouldn't pay them he just stiffed them and you know that sales pitch he's ma to be president put your faith in him and you'll win big that's the e sales pitch he made to all those small businesses then  walked away and left wor people holding the bag he also talks a big game about putting ama first well please explain what part of ama first leads him to make  ties in china not colorado  suits in mexico not michigan  furniture in turkey not ohio  picture frames in india not wisconsin   says he wants to make ama great again well he could start by actually ma things in ama again  now the choice we face in this election is just as stark when it comes to our national security
   
 you know anyone  anyone  reading the news can see the threats and turbulence we face from baghdad to kabul to nice and paris and brussels from san bernardino to orlando we're dealing with determined enemies that must be defea so it's no wonder that people are anxious and loo for reassurance loo for steady leadership wanting a leader who understands we are stronger when we work with our allies around the world and care for our veterans here at home  keeping our nation safe and honoring the people who do that work will be my highest priority i'm proud that we've put a lid on iran's nuclear program without firing a single shot  now we have to enforce it and we must keep supporting israel's security  i'm proud that we shaped a global climate agreement now we have to hold every country accountable to their commitments including ourselves and i'm proud to stand by our allies in nato against any threat they face including from russia  i've laid out my strategy for defeating isis we will strike their sanctuaries from the air and support local forces ta them out on the ground we will surge our intelligence so we detect and prevent attacks before they happen we will disrupt their efforts online to reach and radicalize young people in our country  it won't be easy or quick but make no mistake we will prevail now     says and this is a quote i know more about isis than the generals do no  you don't laughter  he thinks he knows more than our military because he claimed our armed forces are a disaster  jeers well i've had the privilege to work closely with our troops and our veterans for many years including as a senator on the armed services comee and i know how wrong he is our military is a national treasure we entrust our commander in chief to make the hardest decisions our nation faces decisions about war and peace life and death a president should respect the men and women who risk their lives to serve our country  including captain khan and the sons of   and   both marines so just ask yourself do you really think   has the temperament to be commander in chief   can't even handle the rough and tumble of a presidential campaign he loses his cool at the slightest provocation when he's gotten a tough question from a reporter when he's challenged in a debate when he sees a protester at a rally imagine if you dare imagine imagine him in the oval office facing a real crisis a man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons  i can't put it any better than jackie kennedy did after the cuban missile crisis she said that what worried president kennedy during that very dangerous e was that a war might be star not by big men with selfcontrol and restraint but by little men the ones moved by fear and pride  ama's strength doesn't come from lashing out it relies on smarts judgment cool resolve and the precise and strategic application of power and that's the kind of commander in chief i pledge to be  and if we're serious about keeping our country safe we also can't afford to have a president who's in the pocket of the gun lobby  i'm not here to repeal the second amendment i'm not here to take away your guns i just don't want you to be shot by someone who shouldn't have a gun in the first place  we will work tirelessly with responsible gun owners to pass common sense reforms and keep guns out of the hands of criminals terrorists and all others who would do us harm you know for decades people have said this issue was too hard to solve and the politics too hot to touch but i ask you how can we just stand by and do nothing you heard you saw family members of people killed by gun violence on this stage you heard you saw family members of police officers killed in the line of duty because they were outgunned by criminals i refuse to believe we can't find common ground here we have to heal the divides in our country not just on guns but on race immigration and more  and that starts with listening listening to each other trying as best we can to walk in each other's shoes so let's put ourselves in the shoes of young black and latino men and women who face the effects of systemic racism and are made to feel like their lives are disposable  let's put ourselves in the shoes of police officers kissing their kids and spouses goodbye every day heading off to do a dangerous and necessary job we will reform our criminal justice system from end to end and rebuild trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve  and we will defend all our rights civil rights n rights and voting rights women's rights and workers' rights lgbt rights and the rights of people with disabilities  and we will stand up against mean and divisive rhetoric wherever it comes from you know for the past year many people made the mistake of laughing off  's comments excusing him as an entertainer just putting on a show they thought he couldn't possibly mean all the horrible things he says like when he called women pigs or said that an aman judge couldn't be fair because of his mexican heritage or when he mocks and mimics a reporter with a disability or insults prisoners of war like  mccain a hero and a patriot who deserves our respect  now at first at first i admit i couldn't he meant it either it was just too hard to fathom that someone who wants to lead our nation could say those things could be like that but here's the sad truth there is no other   this is it and in the end it comes down to what   doesn't get ama is great because ama is good  so enough with the bigotry and the bombast  's not offering real change he's offering empty promises and what are we offering a bold agenda to improve the lives of people across our country to keep you safe to get you good jobs to get your kids the opportunities they deserve  the choice is clear my friends every generation of amans has come together to make our country freer fairer and stronger none of us ever have or can do it alone i know that at a e when so much seems to be pulling us apart it can be hard to imagine how we'll ever pull together but i'm here to tell you tonight progress is possible i know because i've seen it in the lives of people across ama who get knocked down and get right back up  and i know it from my own life more than a few es i've had to pick myself up and get back in the game  like so much else in my life i got this from my mother too she never let me back down from any challenge when i tried to hide from a neighborhood bully she literally blocked the door go back out there she said and she was right you have to stand up to bullies you have to keep wor to make things better even when the odds are long and the opposition is fierce we lost our mother a few years ago but i miss her every day and i still hear her voice urging me to keep wor keep fighting for right no matter what that's what we need to do together as a nation  and though we may not live to see the glory as the song from the musical hamilton goes let us gladly join the fight let our legacy be about planting seeds in a garden you never get to see that's why we're here not just in this hall but on this earth the founders showed us that and so have many others since they were drawn together by love of country and the selfless passion to build something better for all who follow that is the story of ama and we begin a new chapter tonight yes the world is watching what we do yes ama's destiny is ours to choose so let's be stronger together my fellow amans  let's look to the future with courage and confidence let's build a better tomorrow for our beloved children and our beloved country and when we do ama will be greater than ever thank you and may god bless you and the uni states of ama   presidential candidate delivers remarks at a campaign event dade city florida

 hello dade city  wow  i am so exci about being here thank you all for this really warm wonderful welcome  and i  i think on behalf of all of us i wanna thank alisha machado for that introduction and for sharing  sharing her story with us alisha will be voting for the very first e in this election  and i am very grateful for her support i'm also deligh that we're joined today by your great senator  nelson and his wife grace  i also wanna thank representative amanda hickman from the florida state house  cox  chairman of the greater pasco  chamber of commerce  ledbetter  who is the pasco  county  executive comee chair and his wife beverly  and thanks to retired colonel wilson elkton for his pledge of allegiance and thanks to all the elec officials here  and i especially wanna thank all of you for not just joining us but helping us to get out the vote in this last week  it's almost hard to believe isn't it there are only seven days left in this election  so are you ready to vote  are you ready to volunteer these last seven days  i  too that you are ready to elect pat murphy to the uni states senate  pat whose been in congress will be an independent voice for florida families and i am so exci to think about what he could do because unlike his opponent he's never been afraid to stand up to    now somebody asked me the other day why do you keep coming back to florida just look around folks i mean  it is  it's a beautiful place and i have lots of friends but it's also really important in this election florida can decide who our next president is which will affect the nation and the world  and i want to make sure that every voter in florida spends these next seven days thin about what's at stake in this election because honestly i believe this may be the most important election of our lifees  one week from today we will be choosing or next president and commanderinchief of the uni states  i don't  i don't think the choice could be any clearer you know i have spent my career fighting for children and families i have served in the uni states senate served on the senate armed services comee i was in the situation room when we bought oa bin laden to justice  i represen you as your secretary of state going to  countries negotiating with friend and foe alike i am ready to serve if you give me the great honor of being your president 
   
 now i do have to say that i think that stands in contrast to my opponent and you know maybe for you if you think about all of the issues that separate   from me it could be his dangerous statements about nuclear weapons when a journalist told   that people were worried about how causally he talks about nuclear weapons he said well then why are we ma them
 and i have to tell you yesterday i was in ohio and i was introduced by a gentleman who was one our officers in charge of watching nuclear weapons if the order ever came from our president and what he told the crowd it was a big crowd at kent state university i think every voter should hear basically his name was bruce blair he said that having had the responsibility of sitting in a bunker being responsible for the codes and the keys to our nuclear weapons he knows that when a president makes the order to launch a nuclear attack there is no appeal there is no veto and that is why he has joined with dozens of former air force officers to send a letter to say we need a president with the temperament the steadiness the calmness to be in charge of nuclear weapons and therefore they cannot support   because he does not have the temperament to be our commander in chief and handle those responsibilities  so when you think about voting  early voting this week voting next tuesday  responsibility for our nuclear weapons is on the ballot so is immigration do we want to round up millions of people who are here wor  raising their families as he has sugges he will do i don't think so i think what we want is to bring them out of the shadows so that they can't be exploi by employers  by employers like   who refuse to hire amans and hired undocumen workers so he could pay them less i don't think that's right  now maybe for some of you what   said about prisoners of war will be enough reason to vote against him somebody who'll question the patriotism and the service of  mccain because he was a prisoner of war we need a commander in chief who respects the service and sacrifice of the men and women who wear our uniform  or maybe for some of you it's what he said about a judge born in indiana who just happened to be assigned the case brought by people who were defrauded by the phony  university and so  said well we can't trust him because his parents were born in mexico  now   the  speaker of the house called  well but wait a minute he called what  said about that distinguished federal judge the definition of a racist comment  and then  went on to attack a gold start family whose son capitan kahn died defending our country simply because that family was muslim  and then let's not forget  spent years  years insisting that president  was not born in the uni states even after the birth certificate was produced  honestly if this were something new i  i think we'd all be as ourselves well what  what does he have against president  or what does he have against me but this is not new i know i'm reaching out to s and independents as well as s because i want to be the president for all amans  and here's what i want you tell  i want you to tell your  friends in    took out a $ ad in the new york es to criticize president reagan he said our leaders are the laughing stock of the world so this is a man who thinks that he is better than president reagan better than president  literally better than anybody i guess and when you think about it what he said at the convention i alone can fix it runs counter to who we are as amans we work together so there are many reasons why i think it is fair to conclude that   is unqualified and unfit to be president but today i want to just spend a few minutes focusing in particular about what he has said and what he has done to women and girls because   you know any of you see the debates
 yes
 you know i stood next to  for four and half hours for those three debates proving conclusively i have the stamina to be president of the uni states and during those debates you know  always used to say what have you been doing for  years and i always found that kind of odd because he could google it and find out and so you know i've been a lawyer i've been a first lady and i've been a senator and i've been secretary of state  i've been a wife and a mother and a grandmother and a friend and a churchgoer and for my entire life i've been a woman and when i think about what we now know about   and what he's been doing for  years he sure has spent a lot of e demeaning degrading insulting and assaulting women and i got to tell you some of what we've learned  some of this stuff is very upsetting
 member yes
 i would frankly rather be here tal about nearly anything else like how we're going to create more good jobs and get the economy wor for everybody not just those at the top how we're going to make college affordable for every single family  because i have a plan that if your family makes less than $ you will not pay tuition to go to a state college or university  and if you're above that it will be debt free and we help you pay back the debt you already have so you can get out from under it  but i can't just talk about all the good things we want to do because people are ma up their minds this is a consequential choice so we've got to talk about something that frankly is painful
   
 because it matters we can't just wish it away and you know a lot of his supporters don't like to hear this i don't blame them if i was supporting him i wouldn't want to hear it either to be honest but i got to tell you i learned way back in elementary school and i learned it in sunday school you know it's not ok to insult people it's not ok
 member that's right
 and look at what he does he calls women ugly disgusting nasty all the e  he calls women pigs rates bodies on a scale from one to ten we just heard from alicia she was miss universe when   owned the pageant well he said she put on some weight and it made him angry so he called her miss piggy called her miss housekeeping because she's a beautiful latina  he brought a bunch of reporters to a gym to watch him order her around to exercise  now you know he also said this is somebody who likes to eat well i have to say who doesn't like to eat  i mean really can we just stop for a minute and reflect on the absurdity of   finding fault with miss universe  but you've got to ask why does he do these things who acts like this and i'll tell you who a bully that's who  and thankfully alicia refuses to let such a small person get her down she knows that      doesn't get to decide her value in her eyes and in the eyes of her family and her friends  but what about our girls
 no 
 what about girls watching all this what happens to their confidence their sense of self worth if you've got a daughter a granddaughter a sister a mother a wife a good friend someone like this becoming president who insults more than half the population of the uni states of ama and what about our boys
 no 
 this is not someone we  we want them loo up to
 no  we  don't
 you know not so long ago i was the mother of a teenage girl and you know every day i tried to make sure she knew that she was smart and she was capable and i'm doing the e thing with my granddaughter and my grandson 
 yes yes
 because let's be honest here the world has a way of telling our girls exactly the opposite they don't look right they're not thin enough they don't act right no one will like then unless they change their clothes or straighten their hair or stop being bossy or whatever the criticism might be right and i remember when  was a teenager i would wait on the second floor of the white house in the long hall that's there for her to come home from school and somees we only had a few minutes together but before she'd run off to talk to her friends or do whatever she was planning to i would figure out kind of how were the  how was the day you know we'd talk about what was on her mind and that e together was really valuable to me as a parent
 that's right
 because we parents  and i know there are a lot of parents here today we work hard to give our kids a sense of confidence to send them out into the world believing in their own value
 that's right
 and it really is important that we don't let anybody take that away from them
 yes 
 and we want them to be strong we don't want them to feel bad about themselves
 right 
 and we've got to work hard to make sure our boys just like our girls have that e sense of positive energy not negative not tearing people down   lifting people up and respecting women in fact all of us should respect each other in our country and  so when  i look at my granddaughter and my grandson i am on the e mission i want them to know they're loved they're cared for they're respec i want them to develop a good work ethic i believe in hard work and i want them to go out and prove themselves in the world but that's what i want for every child 
 right 
 i have spent my life doing everything i could to help kids and families it will be the mission of my presidency i will get up everyday in the white house trying to figure out how can we knock down the barriers overcome the challenges so that people living here in pasco  county can get ahead and stay ahead  so i know there's work to be done we can't do it with just words alone we've gotta do more to stop treatment about women being somehow objectified and oh my gosh when we heard that tape and we heard what he does to women i'm not gonna repeat it but you know what   was bragging about grabbing women mistreating women and i have to tell you since that tape came out  women have come forward to say what he said on that tape is what he did to me and then we heard his response what he does at his rallies is to go after those women all over again insulting him he said he  he couldn't possibly have said those things because the women weren't attractive enough to assault
 boos
 look at her he said about one woman i don't think so about another he said she wouldn't be my first choice he's also on tape bragging with the radio personality howard stern about how he used to go backstage at his beauty pageants and he would barge in on women while they were getting dressed  boos
 he said he did that  he said he did that to inspect them that was his word and he said i sort of got away with things like that and sure enough contestants have come forward to say yes that's exactly what he did to us now as bad as that is he didn't just do it at the miss usa pageant or the miss universe pageant he's also been accused of doing this at the miss teen usa pageant  boos
 contestants say that   came in to look at them when they were changing some of them were just  years old  boos
 we cannot hide from this we've got to be willing to face it this man wants to be president of the uni states of ama and  boos
 our wonderful first lady   spoke for many of us  when she said  's words had shaken her to her core for a lot of women who've gone through something like this in your lives that's brought back painful memories and for men who would never ever talk or act like  it's been shoc to see this he tried to explain it away as locker room talk well i'll tell you what a lot of professional athletes stood up and said not in our locker rooms that does not happen  but i guess the bottom line is he things belittling women makes him a bigger man and i don't think there's a women anywhere who doesn't know what that feels like he doesn't see us as full n beings with our own dreams our own purposes our own capabilities and he has shown that clearly throughout this campaign well he is very wrong he is wrong about both the women and the men of this country he has shown us who he is let us on tuesday show him who we are  we can stand up for what we believe what we want for our children and our grandchildren what we know is right and you can go down the list of everything he has said he doesn't believe in equal pay he thinks pregnancy is an inconvenience he won't the minimum wage and he said if he comes home and dinner is not on the table he gets angry  instead of supporting women who're out there supporting their families he wants to make it even harder well i have a message for him we're gonna fight for affordable child care  we are gonna fight for equal pay for all people  we're gonna fight for paid family leave we're gonna fight to make sure everybody gets rising wages in ama and that's important because so many people are still struggling still wor hard raising a family having a hard e getting all of their s paid and that's especially true for minimum wage workers who two thirds of whom are women so we've got work to do my friends i'm exci because i know we can do this and i will stand up and i will fight for you i will work for you i will give my heart to this mission of ma our country all it should be because instead of  's dangerous and divisive vision mine is positive opistic ful and unifying  but i can't do any of this without your help early voting has already begun almost  million amans have already vo and that includes four million right here in florida  amans are voting for the kind of better future we can make together and voting on all the issues that they care about it may be my name and 's name on the ballot but everything you care about  our security our economy bringing our country together the environment  clean water and clear air here in dade city you can vote everyday from now until november th from  am to  pm in fact right now the east pasco government center  just a few minutes' drive away  you can go there right after this rally and vote because we need everybody to stand up in this election if you've got a mailin ballot at home send it in when you get home today don't wait to send it back talk to your friends and family and your neighbors your coworkers and you know  's strategy's pretty simple he says he wants to suppress young people from voting women from voting people of color from voting i mean that's a lot of people by showing up with the biggest turnout ever we will send him and everybody a message that that's not who we are  now i know here in this  this county and this larger region you probably know some people who are going to vote for  and here's what i want to ask you i want you to talk with them ask them what they care about ask them what kind of future they want for our country because  's economic plan is slashing taxes on the wealthy and big corporations i have said i want the wealthy to pay their fair share and i will not raise taxes anybody ma less than $ a year  so there could not be no matter what you cared about a bigger difference between me and   and i  that you will come out and volunteer for these last seven days we are signing people up for volunteer shifts ma calls knoc on doors it really matters turnout matters please go to com to see how you can get involved and here's what  here's what i want to leave you with you know i feel like so many of you  that our country is great but we can make it greater and the main reason ama is great is because aman is good we are a big hear generous people not a small kinded people we know that if everybody works together we will get further together than if we separate people we push them down we engage in all the negativity we've heard too much about in this campaign but somees the fate of even the greatest nations lies in the balance and for ama this is one of these make or break elections it really is in your hands and i  you will think about how you will feel the day after the election on november the th are we going forward together or are we going to be pulled backwards by someone who wants to bully us  and i  i  you will think about how together we can make a difference i want to be your partner as well as your president i want us to create the best possible future for our children and out grandchildren that is what i will work my heart out to do and i  you will help me to make a better fairer stronger ama where we prove once and for all that love s hate thank you allformer secretary of state  rodham   presidential candidate delivers remarks at  c smith university

 whoa it is so great to be here thank you all so much and i was backstage listening to jordan pope's story and it was just so powerful and moving and her ability to stand up here talk about her personal family experienced coming out of  staying strong moving forward being a student here at  c smith university i am so exci  i want to thank her and i want to thank dr carter thank you for welcoming us here you have welcomed two s in the last year there is something about this place that has attrac both my husband and myself i apologize for being late we had a disabled airplane on the runway that had to get moved it took a lot longer than expec but i've been loo forward to joining all of you here in charlotte i want to recognized and thank your mayor mayor jennifer roberts there you are thank you mayor roberts i want to thank trevor fuller chair of the mecklenburg county commission i want to acknowledge josh  candidate for attorney general and to all of you gathered here today it is  days until the election  and i think it's so appropriate to be here in the great state of north carolina at a really well renowned h you know what i'm saying hbcu historically black college and university   that like so many others has played such an important role in our country's history producing some of ama's finest leaders and i am very proud i was just doing a phone call on the way here with a lot of my young organizers on college campuses across our country and i got a question from a young woman at another historically black college and university fayetteville  and i told her that i have a plan to help all of you afford to go to college  i have a plan to help all of you with student debt to pay it down and pay it off  and i have a special plan of a $ ion fund specifically aimed at supporting hbcus   because we need a lot of opportunities for young people from everywhere it shouldn't matter what you look like where you're from or who you love you deserve to be in college if that is your choice  so right now we're up and running we're organizing across ama and as jordan said this election has such high stakes but the highest stakes are for young people young people across ama this election is going to determine in so many ways what kind of futures you will have i don't say that lightly everybody always says every election is important i happen to believe that i think it's one of the great gifts of our democracy that we have the opportunity to choose our leaders and people brave people going back for so many years have fought to preserve that right and that right is under attack right now and it is under attack in north carolina of all places a state that often set the standard for moving everybody into the future and i admired that so much emphasis on education from literally preschool through college emphasis on research emphasis on job creation and innovation and now north carolina under the current governor and legislature has been trying to restrict people's right to vote well you know it north carolina voters though won an important victory when a federal court just struck down this state's voter id law  and the federal court brought back more days of what's called onestop early voting and here's what the court said this is not me tal this is what the federal court said the court said the north carolina law was designed to target africanamans with almost surgical precision now that's not just happening in north carolina unfortunately it's happening across ama and courts have been overturning restrictions that make it harder not just for africanamans but lowincome people latinos young people one of the provisions in the north carolina law was to make it really hard to vote where you go to school so this has been a concer effort to undermine the right to vote even to make it hard for people with disabilities to cast ballots well what's the best way to repudiate that kind of underhanded meanspiri effort to deprive people of their votes get out and vote and make it clear we're not putting up with that  these laws are a blast from the  crow past and they have no place in st century ama  we should be doing everything we can to make it easier to vote not harder that's why if i'm elec president i will work to expand early voting we will enact universal voter registration so every young person in every state is automatically registered to vote when you turn   and we will repair the damage done to the voting rights act and take on discrimination in all forms now hb two is another example of trying to discriminate against people that doesn't have any place in our modern society you've seen this firsthand in north carolina discrimination is not only wrong it's bad for business the nba you know canceled the game paypal canceled bringing i think  jobs others are not coming to this beautiful state because they don't want to be associa with the discriminatory bigo policies of your governor and legislature now one thing you can do about that is change your governor in november  and while you're at it change one of your senators  we're going to need reenforcements up in washington we've got a big agenda and you know people say to me well what is it you're going to try to get done well i'll show you real easy we just published a book right   and i put this book out it's called stronger together it's not very long not a hard read but we have this oldfashioned idea that if we're as you to support us as president we're ought to tell you what we're going to do  not just bluster not just empty words not just demagogic rhetoric real plans that will improve your lives make our country safer and better  so you can pick this up we're going to build an economy that works for everyone not just those at the top sounds like a good idea  we're going to make the biggest investment in good paying jobs since world war ii infrastructure advanced manufacturing clean energy jobs we're going to make the economy fairer raise the national minimum wage get people to work full e out of poverty and we are finally going to guarantee equal pay for women's work it is long overdue  did any of you see the  convention well i don't know you might have missed one of my favorite sets of speakers we had these two young people from kansas  years old young man young woman i'd read about this and i said let's contact these young people and find out their story here's their story seventeen had the e summer job knew each other wor in a pizza restaurant and they were pretty exci i remember when i got my first real job not babysitting but you know actually showing up at a job and having to do it and so one day after they finished work they were tal and the young woman said you know i think ma $ an hour i should be able to at least save something for college and the young man a friend of hers said well i'm ma $ an hour and she said well why are you ma  cents more an hour than i am neither of us had any experience to do this job we're the e age he said well i don't know that doesn't sound right maybe there was a mistake so they go to the manager they tell the manager and the manager fired them both and you know what that's legal if you find out you're not being paid the e for doing the e job you can be fired so this is not some madeup problem and this would raise family incomes and if you have a mother a wife a daughter or a sister who's wor it's your issue so we're going to get that done as well and like i said we're going to make college affordable for everybody pay down debt but we're going to do something else i think it was a mistake when we got rid of all vocational education in high school  it needed to be improved don't get me wrong it wasn't training people for the jobs that were out in the marketplace anymore but we got rid of all of it we need technical education in high school we need more apprenticeship programs where young people can learn and earn at the e e and we're going to go back to emphasizing that in high school community colleges apprenticeship programs creative ideas like coding camps we're going to have  million jobs in  for people who have computer science skills and we're going to only  if we continue on our present path only have  amans prepared to do those jobs i want those jobs to be aman jobs so we're going to help train people of all ages to be able to do those jobs we are also going to defend quality affordable health care for everybody but we're going to get the cost down we're going to get the cost of prescription drugs down for sure  and we're going to emphasize two things that we have fallen short on mental health and addiction services  people i've met here in north carolina and across the ama talk to me about that all the e so again we've got our ideas in here we want you to engage with us give us your ideas this needs to be an ongoing conversation we want you to hold us accountable when we're in that white house trying to do all of this but we also have to keep ama safe and we have to lead the world with steadiness and strength now one of the biggest differences in this campaign is   basically says i alone can fix it whatever it is think of who that leaves out that leaves out our troops on the front line it leaves out our police and fire responders to emergencies it leaves out our teachers our educators who are wor to help young people it leaves out everybody i alone can fix it i was raised to believe that we're in this together and together we can fix it and that is exactly what we're going to do  that's why   and i are running a campaign of issues not insults    has a different approach he wants to build an economy that works even better for himself starting with a $ ion tax cut for his own family he's built a career on stiffing workers mom and pop contractors small businesses that did jobs for him and then he refused to pay them i take this very personally my father was a small businessman that's how he provided a good middle class living for us he prin drapery fabrics he would get the fabric and roll it out on these big long tables you take a silk screen and you'd put it down you'd dump the paint in you'd take the squeegee you'd go across you'd lift it up you'd down the end of one table start at the end of the other table you'd do it until the job was done somees i would be there helping him and then he would load the fabric into his car and he would deliver it i tell you what i am a so grateful he never had a contract with  's businesses  in fact i just ran across the story in las vegas when i was there a few weeks ago of a small drapery business who got what they thought was the greatest contract ever for 's new hotel in las vegas they delivered the goods and they were refused payment for no reason other than it's a game to him everything is a game it's like he's living in his own celebrity reality tv program you know what  this is real reality this is real people this is real decisions that have to be made for our country  he actually stood on a debate stage and said wages are too high in ama now he's got some new advisers he's had a bunch of advisers he's got new advisers and they're all trying to make him look more presidential sound more serious it's not wor too well but remember what maya angelou who spent the last years of her life right here in this state at wake forest reminded all of us  i think about it often i was so privileged to know her when someone shows you who they are believe them the first e  you know stronger together also means wor together with our true allies and partners around the world and last night i offered some thoughts about isis iran how we're going to reform the va system to take better care of our vets and just since last night when i appeared on that program backtoback with  just in the last  hours more retired generals and admirals have signed up to support my campaign  people who have sacrificed and spent their lives protecting our country valuing what makes us exceptional and already great see   and know he should not be anywhere near the white house he is temperamentally unfit to be president and commander in chief  now tomorrow i will hold  i will hold a meeting of bipartisan bipartisan which is what i want to get us back to where s and s work together to make the changes to protect our country i'm going to be meeting with a bipartisan group of leaders and experts to focus more on these crucial challenges but it's hard to forget what  did last night it was a test and he failed it he trash talked about amas generals saying that they've been quote reduced to rubble he sugges he would fire them all and hand pick his own generals since you know he knows so much about what it takes to be a general he attacked dozens of former flag officers at the e e  and here's what i want you to really hear because even i was shocked by this and i didn't know much could shock me coming out of his mouth anymore he praised russia's strong man   even ta the astonishing step of suggesting he prefers the russian president to our aman president that is not just unpatriotic it's not just insulting to the office and the man who holds the office it is scary it is dangerous  it actually suggests he will let  do what  wants and even make excuses for him i said this morning i  i was trying to think about what other presidents would be imagining hearing that coming out of the nominee for the  party what would ronald reagan say about a  nominee who attacks ama's generals and heaps praise on russia's president we've never seen anything like this and one thing you didn't hear from him was any plan to take on isis one of the biggest threats facing our country he says his plan is still a secret well the truth is he doesn't have a plan  i served  i served on the senate armed services comee i served as secretary of state as you know i respect the men and women who put their lives on the line for the country that i love and that i believe in  so whether you're passionate about more good jobs better education healthcare whether you're passionate about protecting our country and the brave men and women who serve us you have to realize as so many s are that this is a e to put country over party i would be saying that even if i were not running against him we have never been threatened as much by a single candidate running for president as we have been in this election as your commanderin chief i will not trash our country's most cherished values i will defend them  and that is especially on my mind because this weekend is the th anniversary of / i was a senator serving and i will never forget the horror of that day or the bravery of our first responders the vics the survivors people i had the honor to work with and represent it's what kept me really so passionately involved on behalf of the people that i served all during those years and that is what i was thin of  years later in the white house situation room i was part of the small group advising president  whether or not the intelligence we had was good enough to take a chance to go deep into pakistan to try to finally bring oa bin laden to justice it was not an easy choice by any means these never are that's why who sits at the head of that table in the situation room has to be able to sort out fact from opinion has to be able to ask the hard questions pursue even the most difficult leads we went through that hour after hour after hour and then the president went around the table as each of us what we advised and we were split because it was not some kind of easy layup i believed it was strong enough that we needed to take action and i suppor ta action that would determine whether or not we were successful that meant sending in special forces now you know what happened i was in that situation room watching that day the most stressful  minutes of my life probably because you remember one of the helicopters nicked  clicked on  hit its tail on the wall going into the courtyard and became disabled that meant  thank goodness there were good contingency plans but you had to get another helicopter in to take out the seals who would no longer be able to fly out on that one but here's what i want to tell you because it is a story that to me illustrate our values in such a clear unambiguous way you've heard   say he would order our troops to torture you've heard him say he would order our troops to kill family members of terrorists you would know that he was advocating illegal actions against our own laws as well as the laws of war thank goodness there's a code of honor in our military stronger than the bluster and the bullying of   because here is what happened on that night  every single second coun that helicopter had to be blown up but before it was  and remember the seals had gone in they had taken out the two kuwaitis the bodyguards they had taken out bin laden's son who was there they took out bin laden they had to get his body out they had to get themselves out but here's what they did first they rounded up all the women and children members of terrorists' families they took them outside as far from the helicopter as they could get them in order that they would not be hurt that   is what aman honor looks like and that is what we're going to stand up and defend in the face of your outrageous disgraceful attacks on the men and women of our armed forces  we're going to unify this country my friends we are going to bring us back together we are going to get things done big things that's who we are as amans i can't do any of this unless you join me in this campaign you can start by going to com or texting join join to  you can knock on doors you can make phone calls register your friends to vote attend a house party in your neighborhood we're going to keep as for your help over these next two months there is so much at stake in north carolina and in ama no one can sit on the sidelines the stakes are high for everyone join the campaign let's build a future where we're stronger together thank you   holds a campaign rally in des moines iowa (sd)

 i am so happy to be back here and to have this chance to talk with all of you and to be introduced by two of the people that i admire most people who have really made a difference in the lives of so many i know everybody in iowa understand that tom and ruth harkin are as good as you can get there isn't anybody better  and i loved serving with tom i had to confess that i miss the idea that he'll be in the senate but you got to hear from patty judge and she would be a great senator for iowa  i want to thank all the elec officials and party officials who are here i've been in  high school before and i'm glad to be back  how many of you saw the  convention  i'll tell you i had just the greatest sense of joy and pride as s took that stage and not just elec officials and people running for office but so many amans who talked about their lives and what they had gone through and what they had accomplished it was positive it was opistic it presen a stark contrast to what we had seen the week before at the  convention  and that's why in this campaign i'm crossing the country to talk about what we can do to improve the lives of the vast majority of amans to create more opportunities for more people to live up to their own potential and to pursue the aman dream and i can't think of a better place to talk about that than right here in iowa because if you build it they will come  after the convention my running mate and i   got on a bus we went through pennsylvania and ohio stopping at factories and businesses tal to groups listening  doing a lot of listening  about what we need to do together and that's why i've rolled out specific plans about how to create more jobs to get incomes rising in the first  days of my administration we will make the biggest investment in new jobs good paying jobs since world war ii 
 now how are we going to do that well we're going to invest in infrastructure  our roads our bridges our tunnels our ports our airports  these are good jobs and a lot of them are good union jobs with good pay and good efits for families  you see i have this oldfashioned idea that the middle class of ama is what makes ama's economy work and what we've been seeing in recent years is a deliberate effort to undermine the middle class some of it because of what's called tledown economics  cut taxes for the wealthy get out of the way of corporations and that didn't work out so well did it  some of it is because the incredible efforts to undermine the right to organize and bargain collectively the aman labor movement helped to create the aman middle class  so in addition to infrastructure that you can see we're going to do water systems we're going to do sewer systems we are also going to build a modern electric grid to take the clean renewable energy that is produced in places like iowa and make sure it can be distribu where it can be used  you know i  i am someone who believes that if we do infrastructure and we do clean renewable energy jobs we're going to be on the way to a st century economy that will work for everybody not just those at the top and how do i know this well because in the past we've done infrastructure haven't we in fact we are living off the infrastructure built by our parents and our grandparents and in some cases our greatgrandparents a lot of it is overdue  overdue for maintenance overdue for upgrades so this will be good for the economy as well as for individual workers and businesses and how do i know about clean renewable energy partly because i spent a lot of e in iowa last year  anybody who says to me well you know we can't really transition to clean renewable energy i ask them have you been to iowa lately  you already get a third of your electricity from wind and there's going to be a lot of people who will be helped by the kind of work we're going to do to make sure that clean renewable energy is available around the country and people who understand that know we can be the clean energy superpower of the st century  and some people get a little carried away have you noticed that  well i get carried away thin about all the jobs we're going to create  and all the families that are going to have a better chance for the future
 i also get carried away by thin about advanced manufacturing because what happened in iowa was not just putting up the turbines you all figured out that you could actually put them together in iowa and employ people who are doing that work and then train people in apprenticeship programs at community colleges to make sure you could maintain those turbines  so the last e i've checked there were about  iowans wor in clean renewable energy  the other thing we're going to do is help small businesses i just came from visiting a great tshirt company raygun right you've been there raygun  met a young man from iowa who star that company employs about  people right here in des moines has stores all across iowa i see another small businessman that i have gotten to know whose got his own ballet bowl bowling alley thank you so much  but here's what we've got to do we've got to make sure that small businesses particularly those star by young people get the credit they need and if they've got student debt i want to put a three moratorium on their student debt payments so they can start their business and see whether they can be successful  my dad was a small businessman and i was really exci to see them ma tshirts on silk screens because that's what my dad did on a bigger scale when he had a little print plant that prin drapery fabrics using silk screens i used to help him from e to e and i believe in small business that's why i want to be a small business president and that's a big contrast with   who has spent his career stiffing small businesses refusing to pay the s  i don't know what would have happened in my family if after my dad had worked so hard he showed up with the fabrics that he prin for the drapes and they said sorry we're not paying you honestly that is not how we do business in ama and so we're going to stand up for small business and help create more of them to help create more good jobs here in iowa and across ama  we are also going to make the economy fairer how are we going to do that we're going to raise the national minimum wage so it's no longer a starvation wage  we are also going to do what tom harkin has stood for his entire life we're going to make sure people with disabilities have jobs and opportunities in this economy  and we're going to make sure that women finally get equal pay for the work we do  so yes i've been laying out plans ever since i showed up here in iowa back in april of  and i am thrilled to be the  nominee to be able to campaign on those plans and take them to washington  now i've got to tell you if you look at the plans i've laid out and one of independent analysts have done that here's what they conclude under my plans we'll create about  million new jobs in ama
 under  's socalled plans we will lose about three and a half million jobs now let me translate that into iowa because if you divide the country by population here in iowa you could gain  jobs under my plans and lose more than  jobs under  's plans so i've got to tell you what i believe which is that if we want to get the economy wor for everybody then we need a campaign that lays out the agenda so people can vote for it so that when i'm elec i can tell the congress this is what the people of ama vo for us to do  so i get pretty exci and pretty carried away enthusiastic about what we can do because we've done it before i couldn't believe all that negative pessimistic talk coming out of the  convention i didn't know what country they were tal about of course we have challenges yes we have problems of course we do but there is nothing ama can't do if we decide to set some goals and pursue them because you know what we are stronger together  and let me say  let me say something about what i think is a critical difference between my opponent and myself words matter my friends  and if you are running to be president or you are president of the uni states words can have tremendous consequences yesterday we witnessed the latest in a long line of casual comments from   that cross the line his casual cruelty to a gold star family his casual suggestion that more countries should have nuclear weapons and now his casual inciting of violence every single one of these incidents shows us that   simply does not have the temperament to be president and commanderin chief of the uni states  so the stakes have never by higher i am humbled and moved by the s who are willing to stand up and say that   doesn't represent their values  not only as s but as amans i have to tell you i feel that e sense of responsibility we may not agree on everything but this is not a normal election and i will work hard for the next three months to earn the support of anyone willing to put our country first  as a young man said to me in florida the other day friends don't let friends vote for  laughter  i also think 's belief that he alone can fix ama's problems is so contrary to who we are as a nation our founders set up our country so that we had three branches of government that had to work together we had the federal government state and local governments that had to work together and that's what we've done so successfully and along comes  and basically says i can do this alone
 well what about the troops on the front lines who rely on each other and support each other what about our law enforcement officers who rely on each other and support each other  what about our teachers and our educators who rely on each other and support each other  what about our doctors and our nurses who rely on each other and support each other  we know that we're stronger together because we've seen what happens when we work together and that is exactly what we're going to do to build on the progress that we've made to set those goals and go after them together but i can't do this without your help i  you will join this campaign please join us  join us by texting join  join  or go to com we are organizing across iowa  we're going to be helping people vote early so that they can make sure that their vote will count we're going to be reaching into every part of this state and we're going to be tal and listening as we did way back in april to learn what's on the minds of iowans and to figure out what you need from the next president now i know that any election is hard it's filled with unpredictable twists and turns but i want you to imagine what you will feel like the day after that election if we have not come together to chart a course of confidence and opism that will really get our economy wor for everyone keep us safe and maintain aman leadership around the world and unify our country that is what i will spend every single day wor to achieve and with your help iowa we will win iowa we will win the election and then we will work together for the future we are see thank you and god bless you  rodham   presidential candidate holds a media availability

 before they cast their votes early or on november th so we will continue to highlight the differences and talk about what we want to do that's going to make life better for the families of ama crosstalk
unidentified male right here with the cameras
 all right and i'm sorry guys i'm wor on a feature
unidentified female so you talk a lot about the middleclass you have throughout the campaign i'm hoping that you can help define it for me and i'm thin both like numally where is the  in terms of policy tax policy where do you put the middleclass and then also philosophically what is the middleclass to you what does it mean
 well the middleclass is the social and economic engine of our country it is in so many ways a reflection of the success of the uni states from the very beginning to create greater economic opportunity for people willing to work for it and it has been one of the premier historic accomplishments of our country going back decades if not longer and the middleclass is a hardtodefine economic target the way i talk about it is to say we know what the median income in ama is but if you're living in highcost areas if you have kids you're trying to educate and send to college if you face healthcare costs that are beyond the average staying in and progressing up in the middleclass takes more money in some parts of ama than it does in inaudible so my pledge has been that i will not raise taxes on the middleclass and i have defined it as i will not raise taxes on anyone ma less than $ a year because in highcost places in ama that is a  in many ways a cutoff that makes sense it's something that president  had adhered to it's something my husband adhered to because when you look at the information and across the country i mean housing is so much more expensive in lots of places than other places and you understand why we've set it at that so the middleclass is both real and aspirational and i want to make sure that it remains strong and it gives people a sense of security and confidence and opism about their futures crosstalk
unidentified female madam secretary how worried are you about thirdparty candidates in general   in particular could he be a spoiler and would he be qualified in your view to be president at all
 well look i am just going to keep running my campaign and do everything i can to encourage people to actually get out and vote i think either   or i will be the president of the uni states and so people have to look carefully in ma their decision about who to vote for because it will be either him or me and i am going to do everything i can to make sure it's me crosstalk 
unidentified female secretary  so   today 
unidentified male you've got a number of  endorsements but polls show the  voters are still solid behind   are still behind  solidly as s are behind you are you disappoin you have not gotten as much  voters support
 i am thrilled of the amount of  voter support i've gotten i really am and from people who understand the stakes in this election and are real thought leaders with a lot of experience so the  national security professionals who came out and said they could not support   some months ago i think spoke volumes about his lack of fitness and qualifications for the job business leaders from  bloomberg to meg whitman and so many others who understand what it will take to have a competitive economy that works for everybody not just those at the top they've been on the front lines and we have an increasing number of people who actually been  office holders one current one as you know congressman hanna from new york to then yesterday senator  former senator warner from virginia who i had the great honor of wor with when he chaired the armed services comee so i'm really honored and proud to have the level of support and the message that it sends by people who understand what the next president is going to be facing and have said   should not be anywhere near the oval office crosstalk
unidentified male  your flight
 oh is this your first flight
unidentified female this is my first flight yes
 welcome aboard
unidentified female thank you very much very happy to be here i appreciate it secretary  the  campaign is signalling that they are poised to get personal about your husband's past about your past how will you respond at the debates and what's your response today
 he can run his campaign however he chooses that's up to him i'm going to keep tal about the stakes in this election i'm going to keep tal about my agenda that will i believe increase growth make it fairer have it be lasting deal with the real problems that families are confronting what i want to do to keep ama safe and to provide the kind of steady strong leadership that the country needs and to bring people together which is going to be one of the highest priorities that i will have when i'm fortunate enough to be elec president if that's what turns out so you know i'm not going to comment on how he runs his campaign you'll be able to see we have two more debates what he says and what i say crosstalk
unidentified female actually i wan to ask you a few follow up questions  go to florida very late tonight tomorrow do you think that   cuba story resonates in particular in florida and you're not a huge fan of continuing the embargo so like who cares or he would have been 
 well you know look we have laws in our country and the efforts that  was ma to get into the cuban markets with his business interests ahead of the laws of the uni states and the requirements that his businesses were operating under because of the sanction shows that he put his personal and business interests ahead of the laws and the values and the policies of the uni states of ama now i was a strong supporter of moving toward creating an opening with cuba when i was secretary of state i applauded president 's efforts and i will continue those when i am president but   knew what the law was and from everything we can tell by those investigative reporting that has been done he deliberately wan it and why should it be surprising that somebody who is happy to give his tax returns to state agencies deciding whether he gets to have a casino but not with the aman people and in fact says it's smart not to pay taxes while he at the e e criticizes and denigrates the uni states of ama so i think it's important for voters to see that this is someone who always puts himself first and even in the cubanaman community there has been a change of opinion about what's the best way to bring freedom and democracy and n rights to cuba but there was also a very clear understanding of what our laws were and who they covered which was clear and unfortunately it looks like he didn't pay attention to them but why should we be surprised crosstalk

 wow 
   
 thank you so much  and thank you for being out here on this beautiful night it is great to be back with all of you on sunday i had the great privilege of spea to the congregation at new mount olive baptist church  and i couldn't leave town without stopping at betty's for some soul food  and it's wonderful to be here with so many of my friends and people i admire i want to thank congressman alcee hastings who just really came out here and revved everybody up  i want to thank the one the only congressman  lewis an icon in the civil rights movement  my friend congresswoman debbie wasserman schultz  congressman  deutch  and i have to tell you i am really exci and very ful that you will send pat murphy to the uni states senate  so let me thank all the elec officials who are here because this is a big deal there are only now seven days left in the most important election of our lifees we cannot take anything anybody anywhere for gran are you ready to work hard and win this election  well that is exactly the right answer because we need to do everything we possibly can between now and the e the polls close one week from tonight because any issue you care about  anything  is at stake i get somees a little overwhelmed of the fact that i love this country and i think we are great  and i think inaudible  we're not going backwards we're going forward  inaudible focus on what's important don't get distrac don't get diver focus on inaudible create  inaudible let's stay focused on one thing on you on your lives your families the problems that keep you up at night and that's what i'm doing now because i know the day after the election that's what really counts  ask yourself what kind of president and commander in chief do we need to get the economy wor for everyone not just those at the top  who can keep us safe and lead the world with intelligence and steadiness and strength  who can begin to heal the divides that have been exacerba between us and bring amans together again well i'll tell you what   has proven himself to be temperamentally unfit and unqualified to be president of the uni states  you know i don't say that about everybody i have known a lot of the people who ran for president on both sides s and s i disagreed with them don't get me wrong but i never thought they were unfit to serve   is different he has proven himself unfit and what he is doing with his conspiracy theories with his insulting with his demeaning and degrading millions of amans proves he should not be allowed anywhere near the white house  so on the one hand you've got to feel kind of sorry about the kind of campaign he's running don't you i mean he starts by insulting immigrants he moves on to insult all latinos he insults african amans he insults muslims he insults people with disabilities he insults pows he then insults women inaudible  by the e you add up all the people he's insul that's more than half the population of the uni states  but here's the good news the good news is there is another vision for ama that's on the ballot  instead of dark and divisive it is ful and inclusive it's bighear not smallminded it's about lifting people up not tearing each other down  it is a vision that says and i believe this with all my heart we are stronger together there is nothing we can't do inaudible  and we believe in an ama that is great because it is good we believe in an ama where women are respec   where veterans are honored   where parents are suppor where workers are paid fairly and we believe in an ama of second chances where people who have served their debt to society get a real chance to rebuild their lives   so we can end the schooltoprison pipeline and build a cradletocollege pipeline instead  and we believe in an ama that will lead the world in the fight against climate change   and create millions of cleanenergy jobs we believe in an ama where marriage is a right and discrimination is wrong  and we believe in an ama that believes in the world and lives up to our values an ama where women finally get equal pay for the work they do  we believe in an ama where we will raise the national minimum wage so no one wor full e will still be in poverty  we believe in an ama where we will defeat terrorists because we will work with our allies in order to put together the coalition that can do that  we believe in an ama where we know the difference between our allies and our adversaries  and we believe in an ama where we're finally do something about the violence of gun epidemics that kill  people a year  we believe in an ama where every young person can afford to go to college and not go into debt  we believe in an ama where we're going to help people who already have student debt pay it back faster more cheaply inaudible  we believe in an ama where we're going to provide quality affordable health care to every person and that includes bringing down the cost of prescription drugs and guaranteeing the security inaudible  inaudible social security is a solemn promise we'll not privatize it we will not turn it over to wall street like my opponent wants to do  we believe in an ama where people ma less than $ should not have an increase in their federal income taxes but the wealthy should pay their fair share  and we believe in an ama where we grow the economy from the middle up and the bottom up not the discredi tledown economics that   has been advocating for and you know by the way we believe in an ama where if somebody claims he's worth $ ion he ought to pay some federal income tax  did any of you see the debates
 yes
 so you know i spent fourandahalf hours inaudible watching   which proves conclusively i have the stamina to do this job laughter  so one of the things i said inaudible i just  when i learned him and studied him and realized inaudible it just sort of stunned me standing next to a guy who flies around in a blue jet who flies around in a helicopter he has his name on those he has his name on buildings and actually one half of the wor undocumen immigrants in ama pay more in federal income tax than he does  you live in an ama where we're going to finally have comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship  we believe in an ama where women are trea with respect  and as i was in pasco county earlier today tal about what's at stake in this election i was introduced by a former miss universe pageant winner alicia machado who   has insul and denigra and really oh if you're miss universe you look pretty good right  and   called her miss piggy insul her heritage called his miss housekeeping because she's a latina well i was proud of her she doesn't let such a small person get her down  but i've got to say that i listened to what he said and how he talks about women and what he has bragged about doing to women i want all the girls in ama to know you are valuable you should feel good about yourselves inaudible  and i want to say to all the young boys show respect because that shows you you're a real man and you inaudible  so you know literally i mean this is so much fun and it's really late but i could be here all night inaudible election  but i think you already know because you've been out here and you've been willing to be here with me because we know that we've got to turn out the vote  and what means is that every one of you who can should vote early how many of you have already vo  and it doesn't surprise me because four million people in florida have already vo  but there are millions more that we've got to get to go out and vote which is what i  we will do talk to your friends your family members your coworkers it is pretty easy to vote early in florida there are lots of different places in this county and every other neighboring county for you to go to and it's important to tell people who got ballots in the mail fill them out and send them in because we need everybody to step up and remember there's no state where it's more important you know what happened in  right i was with in miami and he can tell you better than anyone every vote counts especially here in broward county  and you know this is not complica if people who support our positive inclusive unifying vision vote we win  and we will make history on november the th  so if you've already vo come work with us make some of the calls we're ma millions of calls knoc on thousands hundreds of thousands of doors to encourage everybody to be sure to vote and you know you can vote right near here at the african aman audio gap
  but there are dozens of other sites and all sites in broward county are open from  am to  pm every day until november the th so if you don't know where you're supposed to vote that's easy too you can go to iwillvotecom and that will tell you the nearest earlyvoting location to where you live and i want you to also do me another favor if you know anybody who says they're thin of voting from  i want you to stage an intervention  and i want you to talk to this person because unless they're a ionaire who avoided paying taxes for  years and lost a ion dollars running casinos they don't have anything to gain from   in fact we do have so much to lose every single issue we care about may not be actually lis on the ballot but make no mistake it's on there and talk to your friend and your coworker and say no really you may be angry about something but anger is not a plan  don't be used don't be exploi stand up for what we can do together because that's what this election ulately comes down to it's about our future it's about who we are as a country and i promise you this if you give me the great honor of serving as your president i will wake up every day in that white house trying to figure out what i can do inaudible  ama's best days are still ahead of us inaudible dark pessimistic vision it's not true and it's not who we are as amans so at least stand up and we say no we're rejecting that we're not going back we are going to move with confidence in the future forward into the kind of potential that makes it possible for every single person to live up to his or her godgiven potential then we're going to grow the future we want together and we're going to prove once and for all that love s hate rodham   presidential candidate and sen   vice presidential candidate deliver remarks

what  isn't she the best she did such a good job for us at the convention such a good job so great to have her here boy as we were doing some thank you's and photos everybody who came through the line she gave us who they were and everything about them in  seconds i have never seen a presentation so good your congresswoman in the us senate i have no better friend than sherrod brown sherrod and connie are sitting right there  you are so lucky to have sherrod and you're going to be lucky on the evening of november  when they call this election and you had another great   stland to the uni states senate  my friend  we were governors together and had  we  we spent a lot of good e together when we were governors together and it's great to be here with you  congresswoman beatty thank you so much give it up for joyce beatty and her husband  and then your mayor mayor jackson so good to be with you thank you so much give him a round of applause  and then what a treat to be standing here on stage with these great labor leaders president trumka aflcio what a great friend rich  i got to know him when he was head of the uni mine workers we got a big mineworkers presence in virginia he's a guy who's always told it straight always had my back and i can't tell you how much i appreciate your leadership to this day thank you randi weingarten with aft give her a round of applause  and raise your hand if you are an educator so we can give you all a round of applause to our educators  and then your hometown guy afscme international president lee saunders give it up for lee  now i know that there are other elecs here too in particular i think   might be here give   a round of applause  i think he was here earlier look this is a  this is a big day because i think you know labor day sort of starts the home stretch of the campaign so do we feel like battletes and ready for the home stretch so that we can make history and elect   on the eighth of november  and ohio is going to be there right  you guys have a habit of being there because you know how to do it you know how to do it you know how to make the grassroots work so that we can move progress in this nation forward and that's what we're going to do on november  with   can i just tell you  i'm going to talk for a few minutes and then i'm going to bring her out i know we're really here for her but i want to tell you how proud i am to be on this ticket and i want to tell you something about  when she called and asked if i'd be on the ticket she said something really important that tells you the way she thinks about the job she's going to have to do she asked me and i star to say yes and she said no be quiet i haven't told you why yet she said look the test of a  administration will not be a  signing it will not be the margin by which something passes in the house or the senate that's not going to be the test the test is going to be do we do something that makes a classroom better for a teacher that wants to teach and a child that wants to learn that will be the test  can we do something that will make it safer in a neighborhood or that will make it easier for parents around the table as they're tal about how to afford college for their kids can we do something that will make a workplace safer or a business more able to hire people or a worker find that they can get skills more easy or a job more easy you know the test is going to be  in a  administration  can we make a tangible concrete significant difference in the lives of everyday amans that's going to be the test folks that tells you something about who   is  she is focused upon everyday folks she's running against a guy who's been sitting up on the penthouse and he doesn't even understand the lives of everyday folks and he's not focused on ma the lives of everyday folks any better and so she said look you've been a mayor you've been a governor you've been a senator i think you can help me figure out how to make sure that what we do impacts people in their daily lives so needless to say i'm proud to be on the ticket with the woman who is the most qualified person to be president   that either party has nomina for a long e and probably ever and can i tell you something that really made me mad today   put out a tweet today about our nominee for president and the tweet essentially said she doesn't look presidential does she fellas (booing) wait listen to that again listen to that again this is what he said she doesn't not look presidential does she fellas does she fellas here is my prediction at the end of the second term of     will still be saying that very e thing as he's haw bottled water somewhere and we forgotten that he ever ran for president of the uni states  it is important that we're here on labor day i grew up in a  in a labor house just a quick story my dad ran an iron workerorganized welding and metal shop in the stockyards of kansas city missouri and my dad's shop  some of these guys have heard me tell the story  five employees in a bad year  employees in a good year plus my two brothers and me and my mom and here is what my dad taught me he taught me that his business judgment would put his workers' kids through school but he always taught my brothers and me and the artistry of my union iron workers will put you boys through school it's about teamwork it's about wor together it's about shared prosperity that's what this country is built on and that's what our ticket and our party stand for  shared prosperity the value of hard work and the fact that we can do more and that we are stronger together now since the  since the convention when i got added to the ticket the first thing we did is go right out on trail on a bus tour through pennsylvania and ohio to talk about building an economy that works for everybody that is going to be the number one test of the  administration  wor together can we not put it in a brochure or put it in an ad but can we implement it and do it so that people all over this country see that they have a ladder to climb right that they have a ladder to climb to prosperity thank goodness president  has brought us out of the worst recession since the s  thank goodness for him and you all know he had to do that without one party in congress lifting one finger to help him it was very difficult to create  million new jobs to cut the unemployment rate in half to make pensions and retirement accounts were something again and we owe it to president  to thank him for what he has done  however we also know in ohio and virginia everywhere there is more to do because there are too many people and they might be in innercities they might be in rural ama they might be in coal country they might be in indian country too many people who don't look out and see that they have a ladder that they can climb to success and what we got to do what  and i are bound and determined and promised to do is work together with congress to try to put some important new policies in place so that people see that ladder and we build an economy that works for all and that's why we have been going around the country since the convention tal about what we're going to do we're going to invest in manufacturing and infrastructure and labor will be key   to ma those investments hiring people ma it work we're going to invest in education and skills from early childhood education to giving our teachers the tools and flexibility they need to succeed in the classroom without a lot of topdown strings all over them from washington we're going to make college affordable debtfree for amans and free community college for people who can't afford it  and we're going to reinvigorate career and technical training because you don't just need a college degree to succeed union apprenticeship programs career and technical education are a path to success in the st century we're going to focus on that  we're going to focus on equity raising the minimum wage for god sakes so that you don't work fulle in this country and be below the poverty level equal pay for women i mean what a  what a novel concept that would be child care tax credits so that a wor parent can have a good job without spending too much of their money on highquality child care we're going to do that so it's about investments it's about education it's about equity and it's also about knowing that small businesses are the backbone of our economy twothirds of jobs in this country crea by small businesses  knows that from her family background and i do too that's what we're going to do   folks will be a you're hire president who here wants a you're hired president  obviously obviously well you know what kind of president   is going to be (booing) a you're fired president i mean there's sort of a poetic justice to the fact that when we think about   before he was running for president we knew him as a guy who was known for the two words you're fired when they tell you who they are pay attention to it that's who he is that's kind of  that's the kind of president he'll be and you see it with everything he's done when he was building casinos and golf course headquarters and small businesses like my dad's would get the contract to do the work and they would do the work and they would pay their employees and they would pay their material costs and they would say i'm done what do you think and they would be told yes the work is great well pay me and then  would stiff them hundreds of businesses he wouldn't pay some had to go into bankruptcy because he knew he was a big guy and he thought he could just push aside the little guys and they got hurt  they got hurt because they trus   the students who gave him thousands of dollars to go to his bogus university got hurt because they trus   retirees who gave them money for condos in florida and never got the condos got hurt because they trus   and now   wants us to trust him are you kidding me are you kidding me (booing) he's doing a job interview that's what this is you know when i'm doing a job interview you are interviewing us you're interviewing  and  to be president and he is coming out and he says i want this job and you say well let's see every president since nixon folks has produced their tax returns why don't you produce your tax returns no i'm not going to do it well how about giving information about your health you know medical records no i'm not going to do it how about information about with you own money to wall street banks or the bank of china no i'm not going to do it if somebody came to your office and they wan a summer job and you asked them questions that were important and they didn't answer would you give them the job
 no
 then you cannot give the job of commanderinchief president of the uni states to a guy who won't answer the basic questions of the aman public we just can't do it  he must think we're gullible he must think we're chumps he must think we're marks but we're not ohioans are not gullible virginians are not gullible amans are not gullible and that's why we're not going to elect   and that's why we're going to support the you're hired president    last thing i want to say this is an important thing to me i made my career before i got into politics as a civil rights lawyer i was doing fair housing litigation all over virginia and in other states in the south when somebody was turned away from housing because of their race or because of their disability i would take the case and represent them in court often they couldn't find anybody else to represent them   but i did it because housing is so important and everybody is entitled to be trea fairly regardless of the color of their skin regardless of their disability and you know   got out of law school and she could have gone to wall street but instead she went to work with the children's defense fund fighting to advance civil rights and the juvenile justice system in south carolina the education system in alabama so this is what i did early and this is what  did early and let me tell you about 's early career he came into a family business and shortly after he got deeply involved in it he got sued by the justice department for discriminating against people based on the color of their skin  a massive housing lawsuit brought by the justice department and the evidence was when applications would come in if somebody had dark skin latino or africanaman they would put a c on the application and that would be the signal for that person to get secondclass treatment we do not need a president who thinks that any aman should get secondclass treatment we're all equal in this country  we all deserve firstclass treatment and we got to have a president who understands that now right before i introduce  i just want to say this this is the home stretch you know we  we've done  a number of us have done multiple labor day events already to celebrate labor  but also labor day is the start of the home stretch in the campaign between labor day and election day that's when the focus is on and that's when the spotlight is the greatest and that's when we have to do our best work and you know let me  you said thanks for coming to ohio no i am than you for coming out when we come to ohio  we got to come to ohio we have to come to ohio you all know this you're used to this you're used to the fact that you are one of the two or three most important states in any presidential election going back since there were presidential elections and that's why we're here with you here's what we know about the next nine weeks you're going to see a lot of negative ads on tv right i mean  you know the deal a group can form and get money from some millionaire or ionaire they can themselves citizens for apple pie they don't tell you who they are they put up a bunch of negative ads saying things that are largely false and you can't connect them to it because they won't tell you who they are sadly that's what campaigning has come to these days but we s we know how to do this because we learned how to do it from labor we can beat all the negative ads we can beat all the consultants we can beat all the posters and we can beat them by doing persontoperson right isn't that what ohio knows how to do  and that's how we win  even in a nation of  million people you know i'll tell you something i think people now tuneout the negative ads sherrod had a ton of that money spent against him in  just like i did but people kind of tune it out because they look at it and they  i don't know they're not sure they can believe it but can i tell you what they do believe what people still believe deeply they believe in a word from somebody they care about and from somebody they trust  a neighbor somebody in their church somebody they go to school with somebody they work with if you reach out and talk to them you can persuade somebody who's undecided or you can persuade somebody who is decided but may not vote that this is a very important election for the future of this country are you willing to do that make that persontoperson  persontoperson effort  and i'll tell you something else they don't even have to know you they really don't even have to know you if you call somebody or knock on their door and say i'm a volunteer for   what they're going to hear is volunteer well they didn't have to do this they're doing it because they're passionate about it and our citizens who are trying to decide they want a word from somebody that they can talk to somebody who can answer a question you have the ability to make a difference and get people to take this seriously and see the consequences and we know you know how to do it because ohio always seems to figure out how to do it so between now and november th we're just as raise your hand if you are already volunteering for the campaign all right give them a round of applause that's great for anybody who is not yet volunteering you can do it all you got to do is text together to  that's all you have to do  together  and then you will be brought into the campaign and we can work real hard to make history on november  and then the real work starts ma history every day after november  with president   so now let me do a great introduction i have had a wonderful honor to be on this ticket for  we just did an interview before i came over and somebody asked what have you learned about her and i said i'll tell you something i suspec about her but i have learned it about her this is one lady who never backs down  this is one lady who never backs down from the e she was a teenager in a methodist youth group she has been impassion and focused on the success of families and kids and folks whether she's been in office or out whether she is winning or losing whether she is getting something passed or having the other side knock it back she does not forget where she came from she does not forget what motivates her and that's why i am so proud to say i'm with  we're with  we're going to make history with  please welcome   the next president of the uni states 
 hey cleveland happy happy labor day  when we were trying to figure out where we could be we all said let's go to cleveland  and i want to thank congresswoman marcia fudge for hosting us 
   
 i haven't talked so every e i think about  i get allergic  boy we have  days to go
  days  days  days
 well thank you well  well you just heard the next vice president didn't you  in addition to than marcia fudge let me also thank your great senator sherrod brown also  excuse me also two other great members of congress   and joyce beatty  and your mayor thanks to mayor jackson  and i   i  that ohio will send  stland to the senate  now behind me are some of the great labor leaders of our country  randi weingarten   lee saunders   rich trumka  i'm proud to be on the e stage with them because they're always fighting for wor families now once i get over my allergic reaction laughter  let me say that we are here in part because we know how important this election is to ohio it's not just as  said  that ohio is one of the battleground states you hear about every four years it's that ohio represents everything that's great about ama and all of the challenges and the opportunities that we face that's why this election is critical to every person in this state and what i want to emphasize is i know we can't face our problems alone we have to work together we believe we are stronger together and that is in stark contrast to   remember what he said at his convention he said i alone can fix it now think about what that leaves out my friends that leaves out all of our troops on the front lines it leaves out our police officers and firefighters who run toward danger it leaves out doctors and nurses who care for us it leaves out teachers and educators who care for the most important people in our lives our children it leaves out everybody except him and when he says i alone can fix it that clearly demonstrates he doesn't understand how ama works how we got great and why we are great today and what we need to do together to face the future because our campaign is about we will fix it together we will work together we will bring our country together  and what better example of that are our labor unions they are built   on the principle of solidarity they look out for each other they fight for fair wages and collective bargaining for safe wor conditions just last week we learned once again because another study came out that confirms what we already knew when more workers are in unions wages are higher and not just for union members but for all workers  that's why if  and i are elec we're going to say no to attacks on unions no to rolling back collective bargaining no to unfair trade deals like tpp no to pension cuts that deny you the secure retirement that you've earned no to right to work because right to work is wrong for workers and wrong for ama  but we're not just about saying no we're going to say yes to standing up for workers rights and dignity yes to good jobs and efits yes to the aman dream it is big enough for everyone to share the promise  and so that's why during this campaign i have been running a campaign based on issues not insults  i believe anyone who asks for your vote should tell you what they're going to do starting tomorrow you can read about the plans  and i have because we're putting out a book did somebody have a copy of that book hey somebody back there you got a copy of the book i can show the crowd we're putting out a book called stronger together  that's more than a slogan for the campaign that's a guiding principle for the future we want to build and that's exactly what we're going to do now some people say wait a minute you've got so many plans well you're right i do have plans you know why because i want you to know what i want to do to help you and what kind of results we're going to work to achieve i have this oldfashioned idea that if you're as somebody to vote for you they ought to tell you what they want to do and then hold you accountable when you get elec  and i'll tell you what our plans start with a very simple idea that we're going to get the economy to work for everyone not just those at top we're going to do it with the biggest investment in new jobs that we've had since world war ii more infrastructure jobs advanced manufacturing jobs clean renewable energy jobs anyone willing to work hard should have a job that can support them and their families a job with dignity with only a future to be proud of not to worry about we're also going to offer new solutions for families families are different today than they were in the s for heaven's sakes so we need to make sure we help support families the way they are today not way back when helping people support and balance family and work with paid family leave earned sick days affordable childcare  and finally guaranteeing equal pay for women's work  and here is our book it's called strong together for a reason you can read about what we want to do on the economy and everything else it will be available starting tomorrow because the choice for families has never been clearer just look at  's track record when it comes to hardwor men and women i know i'm allergic to it too but we have to look at his record there are many people you know who are thin about voting for him and you know friends don't let friends vote for   and here is what you can tell among many things he hired a unionbusting firm to break up and organizing campaign at his hotel in las vegas he built his career on refusing to pay workers plumbers painters glass installers marble installers people who did work for him and then he refused to pay them he stiffs small businesses like my dad my dad and 's dad had really small businesses that gave us a good middleclass life i am just so grateful my father never got a contract from    my dad worked hard he prin drapery fabrics and i would go help him somees there'd be a long table in his print plant and the fabric would be rolled out and then the silk screens would be laid down and then you pour the paint in then you take the squeegee you push it across the screen you lift it up you go all the way down and you go to the second table all the way back then when he finished he'd load those drapery fabrics into his car and deliver them i don't know what would have happened to my family if he had done a big job thin it was a good deal for  and he gets there and the  people say we're not going to pay you and then after harassing maybe they say ok we'll pay you  cents on the dollar he has driven hardwor people into bankruptcy and taken six bankruptcies himself now here in ohio you know very much that a president makes decisions that affect people's lives and livelihoods when millions of jobs were on the line in the auto industry president  made the right decision to save the auto industry  i know we've got some uaw members here  i was proud to support them then i'm even prouder now that the auto industry just had its best year ever  think how differently things could have turned out i know this is hard to imagine if it had been   in the oval office last year  remember this last year he said it didn't matter whether or not we save the auto industry either way would have been acceptable he said we could have just let it go never mind the  people in ohio and millions more across the country whose jobs and paychecks were tied to the auto industry now what else could we expect from someone whose most famous words are you're fired this is the kind of difference that this election really poses people like  and me who want to create more good jobs with rising wages and efits for everybody willing to work hard that's the basic bargain of ama and somebody who stiffed people to bankruptcy and laid off people one of his bankruptcies put  people out of work every e you hear him talk about how he knows how to create jobs just look at the facts educate yourself and your friends and your colleagues because the kind of bluster and wild claims that he makes about everybody and everything don't stand up to any scrutiny the e is true when it comes to whether we keep our country safe stronger together means wor with our allies and our partners right  we're not just electing a president we're electing a commanderinchief so when   says and i quote i know more about isis than the generals do when he claims as he has that our armed forces are a disaster or he insults a gold star family that's not just wrong and offensive that's dangerous our military is a national treasure and a president must respect the men and women who risk their lives and wear the uniform of our country  some of you know  's son is deployed right now he's a marine   and i will not only respect our men and women in uniform we will protect them and we will ensure that they are given the resources that they need to do the dangerous missions we ask them to do on our behalf last week we saw even more evidence that  is temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be president in just a few hours he managed to turn his trip to mexico into an embarrassing international incident he even got into a twitter war with the president of mexico and then he delivered his most hatefilled hard hard line speech yet  doubling down on his absurd plans to send a deportation force to roundup  million people to deport them now you can't make this stuff up can you he can try to distract with divisive dangerous rhetoric he could try to fool voters into thin somehow he's not as harsh and inne as he seems but it's too late when you see what he has said and done in this campaign when you see that he can't even go to a foreign country without getting into a public feud with the president i think the answer is clear   does not have the temperament to be our commanderinchief  imagine him in a real crisis i've said it before and i believe it  a man you can bait with a tweet cannot be trus with nuclear weapons  now look i know that these elections are always tight and hard i am not ta anybody anywhere for gran that's why we're here today because we need your help we need to make sure we have an election that validates the kind of positive future that will make life better for the people of ohio and empty promises and raises to tax will do that it won't get your family a job it won't keep our troops safe it won't heal the divides in ama i've spent my life fighting for kids and families during the fight for health reforms some of you remember powerful interest blocked our way but i didn't give up i turned around i worked with s and s to help pass the children's health insurance program that covers  million kids today  that's how you deliver real results you can't get discouraged you can't give up you can never quit but you got to start from the right values and principles you've got to believe in our country you've got to believe in the aman people  i'm as for your help in these next two months i'm as you to reach out to your

 oh my goodness thank you  thank you all so much  it is great to be back in cleveland i am thrilled to see all of you i have to really thank lebron what he does on the basketball court you all know it makes him so special it makes him a champion  but i am just as impressed as i have told him about what he does off the court  because what he does off the court is to care for every child as though that child were his own he has been so commit through the lebron family the lebron james family foundation he's using the national platform he earned to advocate for children everywhere especially right here in ohio  and it was an extraspecial treat to have jr smith here as well  i can't tell you how exciting it is for me to have lebron and jr part of the team that's going to take us to the white house starting on tuesday  i also have to thank a lot of the elec officials that i've worked with that i have such high regard for let me thank your senator sherrod brown  let me thank your amazing absolutely indefatigable congresswoman marcia fudge  let me thank your county executive armond budish  and let me thank and  you will vote for your former governor  stland to be your next senator  i want to thank the dj steph floss for his musical performance  and i want to thank a very special young man yusef salaam who was out here  a young man who has turned what was a very bitter and unjust experience into an opportunity to try to help lift others up now i was thrilled to be here on friday night with jay z and beyonce  beyonce even had her dancers in blue pantsuits which i love  but what was most important was how beyonce and jay z talked about what this election means for their daughter and for all of our daughters and sons and that's why i am so grateful to them as well as to lebron because this election really is about the future and it's about your kids and grandkids and every child in this country that we  will have their own shot at the aman dream they may not all become champion basketball players but everybody should have the right to go as far as their hard work and talent will take them in ama  so let me ask you this are you ready to vote  are you ready to volunteer for the next few days  are you ready to choose our next president  well i think by now you know the choice could not be any clearer it really is a choice between division or unity between an economy that works for everyone or one that is stacked for those at the top between strong steady leadership or a loose cannon and as you think about this choice i want you to know where i am coming from because what i want to do as your president is really to build on and continue what i've done my entire life fighting for kids and families   standing up for our country if you elect me on tuesday that's what i will do every day as your president because from the start our campaign has been focused on you you know i have now spoken in front of hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people in small groups and big events and what i try to do while i'm up here spea is to really look at the faces of the people in front of me because i don't know your dreams i don't know your struggles but i want so much to convey to you that i will be on your side i will fight for you fight for your families fight for your futures  i want us to do all we can to help you get ahead and stay ahead and my vision is very different from my opponent's look we know we know enough about what he says and what he's done you don't need to go through the litany of all the people he's insul and demeaned but the bottom line is his vision of ama is so dark and divisive it's not the ama that i see as i travel around our country i want us to have a vision that is ful opistic and unified about what we can do together to make sure ama's best years are ahead of us  i love our country and i believe in our people and i will never ever quit on you   no matter what now that is not to say we don't have our challenges of course we do we're just n beings but boy we have so many assets we have so many opportunities and never forget ama is great because ama is good  and if we act like that we lift each other up instead of tearing each other down we can be even greater we've come through some tough economic es and lots is changing in our country there are powerful forces inside and outside of ama that do threaten to pull us apart and we've arrived at a moment of reckoning in this election our core values as amans are being tes i think of all the people i've met across the country in this campaign i've heard some really really sad stories you know when you run for president at least for me the moments that stand out are about somebody grabbing my hand i'll be in a coffee shop or maybe sha hands on a rope line and somebody will grab my hand and they will share a really personal feeling or experience with me a lot of es it's about problems or troubles in their families and i feel like they are entrusting me with this really important piece of their lives i walk away from that motiva but i also walk away confident my faith in our future has never been stronger and i know if we come together not just to win the election that's just the beginning but then to work together there is something for every one of us to do in our own lives our families our neighborhoods and communities i want an ama where everyone has a place where everyone's included and you know i know there's a lot of frustration and even anger in this election season i see it i hear it somees you know i'm the subject of it i get it but anger is not a plan anger is not going to get us new jobs with rising incomes   that will create a strong thriving middle class i believe that we're going to grow this economy we're going to grow it from the middle out and the bottom up not the top down  that is what my opponent offers and it might work for him right it might but it's not going to work for the vast majority of wor amans that's why i want us to have a big infrastructure jobs program that is so much work to be done good honest honorable   dignified work our roads our bridges our ports our airports our tunnels our water systems and these are jobs that can't be expor they've got to be done right here in cleveland   in youngstown in dayton in akron in columbus and cincinnati and we're going to bring back advanced manufacturing to ohio and elsewhere in our country now some people when i say this they kind of you know look at me like well that's not going to happen it is going to happen and i'll tell you two of my strongest allies are going to be sherrod brown and marcia fudge and i   stland when he gets to washington  people say to me all the e well how are you going to get anything done won't there be gridlock there will only be gridlock if people that are elec to represent you don't want to help you it's not complica my friends if they want to keep helping the wealthy the powerful and the wellconnec yeah then we're going to have gridlock because i want jobs with rising incomes i want people having a better shot at the future  and we are going to have more clean renewableenergy jobs to combat climate change and put amans to work  and i want to be the best president small business has ever had because that's where most of the new jobs will come from  and once we get these new jobs and we start producing more things in ama i want people to buy those things in ama  you know any of you see the debates  you know in that last debate i poin out that   has bought chinese steel to build his last two buildings all the while he's been running around ohio tal about what a great advocate he's going to be for wor people  he didn't have to buy chinese steel he didn't have to help employ chinese steelworkers he could have bought good aman steel made by aman steelworkers  so don't just watch what we say watch what we've done for the last  years and whose side we've bet on  and we're going to make this economy fairer look i really believe in hard work that's how i was raised that's the kind of family i came from so i think everybody has to work everybody who can needs to work but i do think we need to raise the national minimum wage   because if you work full e you shouldn't still be in poverty and i also think if you're wor you ought to get paid fairly which is why we need to guarantee equal pay for women's work  and you know this is not a woman's issue this is a family issue because if you've got a mother a wife a sister or a daughter wor you don't want her shortchanged
 no
 and we need to start recognizing that a lot of the costs that families are facing now are really burdensome i want to get child care affordable right  do you know in a lot of states right now good child care costs as much or more than instate college tuition that's crazy who could afford that and i want us to have paid family leave so if you get sick or your spouse is sick   or your parent is sick or your child is sick or you bring a newborn home now you know i don't think these are luxuries anymore i think these are all about rebuilding the aman middle class i believe it's all about respecting work providing enough jobs for people to have a good future getting incomes rising ma it work for everybody and i have said i will pay for everything i'm proposing without adding a penny to the national debt right  and that is in very start contrast to my opponent because what i've said is i am not raising taxes on the middle class anybody ma less than $ a year is not going to have any tax increase while i am president  but i am going where the money is and the money is with the wealthy and corporations because they've done really well in the last  years and they should pay their fair share to support our country  and again people say to me well how are you ever going to get that through congress well i'll tell you i think it's pretty simple i'm going to look at all the people all the people who would be helped by everything i've just said the new jobs and the rest of it and i'm going to compare it to the very few people in every congressional district who would have their taxes raised and i'm going to say whose side are you on mr or madam congresswoman are you supporting the five people in your district who will have their taxes raised or are you supporting the  people who will be efi by what we're going to do together  and another big barrier that we've got to knock down is ma college affordable for every single person  it's outrageous i meet people across ama who couldn't afford to start college could not afford to stay and never gradua and still have debt they don't have a degree but they've got debt that's crazy and i see some people pointing to themselves i've got to tell you look i believe that education is an investment that's why i want good schools with good teachers in every zip code in ama  that's why i want to get more technical education back into high schools because i think there are a lot of great jobs waiting to be done by people who have the skills from high school or community college   or apprenticeship programs i'm going to do everything i can to lift up and honor hard work when somebody can make something when somebody is a machinist or a tool and dye maker or a carpenter or even a computer coder that may not at all require a fouryear college education and it's about e we honored all work in ama and made all work pay for everybody  but for people who want to go to college we're going to make it easier i want every public college and university to be tuitionfree for families ma less than $ a year   and debtfree for everybody else because this should be seen as an investment and if you are struggling with student debt we've got a plan to ease that burden get the costs down get the interest rates down get it paid off much faster you see i really believe that every single person should be able to go as far as you're willing to work for it and not have your dreams dashed while you're a child or a teenager or a young adult elections are about the future so let's lift up the young people of ama  and that includes let's dismantle the socalled schooltoprison pipeline and replace it with a cradletocollege pipeline  we have a lot of work to do i've laid out a full agenda   my running mate and i we've written a book called stronger together and in it it tells you everything we want to try to do and i've got to tell you i think it's important you know what we want to do it shouldn't just be an election about words it should be about plans and policies so that you can judge and say what will help me like for example on college you can go to my website com right now com/calculator and you can see how much money you and your family would save under my plan and i want to be real specific i want to rebuild confidence in what we can do together it's not good for anybody that our democracy and our country are viewed so suspiciously without confidence that is how we govern ourselves so we have to work together but i can't do any of this if you don't vote  now so far  million people in ohio have vo  but we've got work to do so please you've got to get out you've got to get to the polls you've got to take people to the polls nobody should sit this one out you can go to iwillvotecom to find out what your polling place is or you can volunteer to help us these next few days you can text join join to  and i'm really ready to get to work for you this is about what we can do together  it's about the kind of future we can create and build and it is an opportunity for all of us to be inves in a better fairer stronger ama i want us to do this together i really do believe my slogan stronger together  so i  ohio will turn out in the biggestrecorded vote in history on tuesday  and we will together prove once and for all that love s hate thank you all very much rodham   presidential candidate delivers remarks at a campaign event in pierce florida (sd/)

 hello  thank you 
   
 thank you so much
   
 thank you
    
 thank you so very much wow  what  what a wonderful welcome it's great to be here in fort pierce in this beautiful theater  i love being in the sunshine state and  i really want to recognize a few people us congresswoman lois frankel is here as you saw  randy perkins a candidate for congress  kim  chair of the st lucie county commission  larry lee  state representative  everyone all the elec officials all of the students and young people it is wonderful to be with you and i want to thank eileen for her introduction we know how hard nurses like eileen work  and now that she is retired she is volunteering for our campaign this woman never quit and eileen we are so glad you are on our team  i am grateful to all of the elec officials all of the commissioners the county commissioners  county st lucie for all you do for the community but especially for all you did this summer to clean up the algae that pollu the water  that threatened wildlife and made life hard for local residents and businesses this is a serious complica problem isn't it
 yes
 for the entire treasure coast
 yes
 and it is a reminder if we needed it how important good leadership is  so i thank all the leaders for their commitment now there are  days between now and november th
 just  days left in the most important election in our lifees we have to make every single day count we have to get more people registered to vote get more people commit to turn out to vote we have to drive home the stakes in this election stronger family safer communities an economy that works for everyone not just those at the top  and underneath all of the rhetoric and the coverage and the back and forth this campaign really comes down to two questions what kind of future do we want for ourselves our kids and our grandkids and how do we make it a reality now as i said the other night how many of you saw the debate 
    
 well as i said i now have two grandchildren and no offense anybody the two most wonderful amazing extraordinary little girl and little boy and so i think a lot about the future and you may have noticed that my opponent and i have different views  about well nearly everything when it gets right down to it not just about what makes ama great because i think ama already is great  but about what we should do to make it even greater and about that basic question of how progress happens at all my opponent believes in what i call a strongman approach he stood on that stage at his convention and described a less broken nation i'm sorry i'm loo at you i don't see that  that in no way resembles the strong vibrant ama i know and  and here is what he said he said i alone can fix it  i alone well we've learned that that's his way one person getting supreme power and exercising it ruthlessly that is why he admires dictators like   so much but that is now how change happens in ama it is never just one person not even someone as powerful as the president every good thing our country has ever achieved has always happened because people have worked together to make it a reality  not just the wealthy or the powerful all of us we see that every day across ama and i bet many of you have been part of it maybe you've taught kids to read right or cleaned up your local park or the beach maybe you've organized a cancer walk or you've run a food drive whatever it is chances are you have done something to serve your community and by extension your country how many of you just think back over your lives how many of you have performed some kind of service of some sort for your community for other people
 the reason i know you have is because tens and tens of millions of amans do some kind of volunteering in your hometowns every single year it is one of the best things about the aman people we are doers
 we are doers 
 you know we don't just shrug our shoulders when we see something that needs fixing we get resigned or apathetic or blame other people and turn on each to find scapegoats we roll up our sleeves we get to work to try to make things better in our neighborhood our community our city our state and our country that has been our story the aman story since the beginning of our nation and it is still going strong today now for many amans including a lot of you here serving our country has included serving in our armed forces  people are starting to call out their services laughter there is no greater service or sacrifice and we are grateful to our men and women in uniform to their families and our veterans every single day  but what's so great is that national service can take many different forms and it's something that i believe in so deeply that every stage of our lives gives us a chance from grade school through grandparenthood to find a way to give back we've got folks here today from amorps  which my husband crea back in   and i will tell you to this day it is one of his proudest achievements because every day amorps members are there they're building houses responding to natural disasters helping people with disabilities my jobs find safe places to live and next week on october th amorps will celebrate a major milestone their one millionth member  i will tell you  i will tell you  is really exci about this and so am i and by the way amorps has one of the best swearingin pledges i have ever heard here is how it starts i will get things done for ama isn't that great  i think we should make that a national slogan
 yes
 now we also have folks here today from city year which is part of amorps  and every day they're wor with students who are at risk of dropping out of school they're tutoring and mentoring and running after school clubs all to help young people really discover how capable they are and to be empowered and to stay in school i am really grateful to them we also have people here today from the peace corps which represents the best of ama to the world  these corps volunteers are teaching english in kosovo  staffing health centers in nicaragua supporting farmers in nepal distributing malaria nets in uganda
 both as first lady and as secretary of state i got to see the results of their work firsthand they are ma the world a healthier more prosperous and more peaceful place now maybe not all of you have been a part of one of these programs but i know you serve in different ways maybe you volunteer through your school with your church or synagogue maybe you find through faithbased organizations as i did when i was a teenager service opportunities because for many amans service is part of our faith my running mate   volunteered in honduras with the jesuits as a young man and it changed his life or maybe your whole family volunteers together  and  and i every holiday season would work at a food bank back in arkansas however you serve it feels good doesn't it to be part of something bigger than ourselves  to take our e and labor and put it towards something good that can happen in our country and the world and you know something very interesting service makes us happier it makes us healthier and there are studies proving that it's not just how we feel they've actually followed people it can also help us find our next job or our true calling in life it's a smart way to use our greatest asset our people and service does something important for us as a society too often we amans can become separa from each other and i think a lot of people are feeling this way during this election it's easy to surround ourselves with only those who think like us talk like us look like us read the e news as us that's understandable to an extent but it comes with a cost because it magnifies our differences which then makes it harder to put those differences aside when our community or country needs us there aren't many places where people of all ages all races all backgrounds all beliefs come together in common cause but service is one of them and that's one of the reasons i think it's so valuable because in addition to the good work it does it helps us reconnect with each other to feel more a part of our shared aman life i believe one of the jobs of the president is to encourage more service to help more amans answer president kennedy's call you know it ask not what your country can do for you but what you can do for your country  but you know somees it's hard to figure out how do you make a difference especially with everything else going on in our lives and too often volunteering becomes something only people with lots of e and financial security can do but that's not how it should be everyone should be able to contribute so what if we as a country made it easier for everybody to do that for everybody to give back what if we crea more service opportunities for amans of all ages inves in programs that work and encouraged entrepreneurs to add a social component to their businesses what if we strengthen the culture of service in ama    so it wasn't just something we did one day a year but it became a regular part of our lives i think that would reflect our values and tap into something so great about ama
 i talk a lot about how ama is an exceptional nation we're not exceptional just because of the size of our military or the size of our economy we're exceptional because of the generosity and ingenuity of our people  way back  nearly  years ago a frenchman came to the uni states his name was alexis de tocqueville he traveled around he was trying to figure out what is this new place called ama they fought a revolution what are they doing who are they and he saw how we set up our government and we had three branches and everything that our founders really put into place but the thing that made the biggest impression on him was our spirit of volunteerism that made democracy as diverse and ambitious as ours possible if i am elec president this fall i want to build on that strength by ma a major push in support of more national service  so here is what i plan to do first let's triple amorps  that was the goal of my friend and the great senator  kennedy it was laid out in a law named in his honor the edward m kennedy service ama act it's finally e we get it done every year there are hundreds of thousands of more applications for amorps than there are spots in the program so if we grow the program from  annual members to  we're going to give more people who already want to serve the chance to do so and then i want to double the college scholarships that amorps members earn through their service  and i want to find ways for more students to get college credit for service  because i know too many talen commit young people pass up on serving with amorps because with their student loan they can't afford it
 that's right
 so let's lighten that burden if you do national service we will began a program to forgive your loans because you are giving back to your country  and let's keep wor for the ulate goal of ma it possible for any aman to serve fulle if they want to now second let's grow the peace corps  since president kennedy launched it  years ago it's given nearly a quarter of a million amans the experience of a lifee and it has fostered friendships and cooperation between amans and people in more than  nations we've got to do more of that in the world today we need more amans of all ages around the world showing our values serving people so let's make it possible for more amans to be a part of this extraordinary program
 third let's expand service opportunities for people of all ages right now let's be fair the younger generation is way ahead on this i've talked to so many young people who are deeply thoughtful about how your lives impact others and the world service isn't just something to do to check a box before graduation it really is woven into your lives and many who are just getting star in your careers say that having a positive social impact is more important to you than getting a job that yes pay a salary but doesn't give you any meaning or purpose in your lives  and i love the fact that as you do service you come up with new ways of giving back and find a path into charities and nonprofit organizations and other ways to serve that's a sign of true commitment i've also been impressed by how many young entrepreneurs tell me that they're building a social component into their businesses whether it is dedicating a portion of their profits to a charity giving employees e off to volunteer or adopting a school or community center as a pro bono project for the whole company that's why my plan to help you refinance and pay back your student loans includes loan forgiveness if you launch a social enterprise or start a business in an underserved community  we should make it easier for young innovators to follow their dreams while honoring their values and giving back now i also want to get older amans more involved service isn't something only students and young people do i know that so i intend to make sure that  percent of amorps slots go to amans over the age of   let's give people an encore opportunity after they've ended their formal career so they can apply a lifee of knowledge and experience toward a stronger community and finally i want to create a new means for people to serve in serious meaningful ways without a fulle commitment you know amorps is a fulle commitment the peace corps is a fulle commitment the armed forces are a fulle commitment but the armed forces has another model the reserves right it gives people the chance to make a highimpact contribution while still building careers and pursuing their dreams in other ways so let's do something like that in the civilian space let's call it the national service reserve  and here's the idea if you join the national service reserve you will receive some basic training just like you would in the military reserves and then when your city or state needs you you'll get the call say a natural disaster strikes and the red cross needs all hands on deck or maybe like the crisis in flint and clean water has to be distribu every day to a lot of families or maybe your city launches a major public health campaign to reduce drug abuse or promote mental health you will then be sent into action
 now some of these assignments may be just for a few days a month some might be longer term but they will directly address a vital need in your own community and what are the other advantages because you can help meet that need while still being a fulle student having a job ta care of your family you won't have to make service your only priority our goal is  million people spread across all  states and  we will have an open door the people of all ages but we want to put a special focus on people under  who've said again and again they want to have a bigger impact in their communities but they cannot leave their jobs understandably we'll work with governors and mayors s and s because i want this to be a true bipartisan publicprivate partnership  i also want to include businesses colleges and universities who have unique resources to offer and because we want workers and students to know that as a they make this contribution their schools and their employers will have their backs i really think a national service reserve could make a difference for cities and states there's so much work to be done and so many people who want to help do it so let's bridge that divide get people wor together in ways that can help communities now i do not think you will hear anything about this from my opponent laughter and you know what i think that is a shame because national service has always been a bipartisan goal  of course president kennedy star the peace corps and my husband star ama corps but president nixon signed the domestic volunteer service act president  hw  crea the white house office of national service and both president  w  and president  have been huge champions of service this should be something that we all can get behind and  when you listen to what is being said in this campaign it can be discouraging right
 yeah
 it can seem hard to find any common ground so that makes it even more important that we come together wherever and whenever we can now i am well aware that candidates do not usually focus on national service in the final stretch of a hotly fought presidential election some might say well hey my gosh you've only got  days to go why aren't you just out there you know beating up on your opponent and doing everything to get the vote out and all the rest of it well i will do that but laughter  i've been thin about this a long e and i did not want this campaign to end without tal about it because it means a lot to m i'm trying to end the campaign focusing on issues that are really close to my heart and this is one of them 
 we love you 
 thank you  you know for me service is really all about fulfilling the instruction of my methodist faith and you can see part of  the creed i like to follow behind me
 do all the good you can in all the ways you can in all the places you can at all the es you can to all the people you can as long as ever you can  now i've carried those words with me ever since i heard them as a little girl and it's an idea that really got into my head and my heart but you know what's kept me going are the people that i've met in a country founded on liberty and equality i can't think of a more important notion than every one of us is valuable we all deserve respect we all should listen to each other we all can make our mark on the world  and when we come together in common purpose we can do so much more than we can ever do on our own that's why stronger together is more than a slogan it's a course of action  so here's what i want to do i want you to hear me pledge that this will be a vital aspect of my presidency and i want you to help me bring our nation together to solve our problems strengthen our communities to join with people across ama who care about service because it speaks to both what is great and good about the uni states you know ama is great because we are good  so there are lots of examples we're gonna be putting examples up on my website of people who have served and who are inspirations but i want everybody here to know that it can be done we can do more and we can provide the opportunities to enlist more people there are so many examples in this community and communities across ama thirtynine days left this is the choice do we lift each other up or do we tear each other down  do we listen and respect each other or do we scapegoat point fingers and insult each other well i tell you what side i'm gonna be on and with your help we're going to demonstrate on november th what kind of country we really are thank you and god bless youformer secretary of state    presidential candidate delivers remarks at a campaign event

 i know i'm only the second most exciting thing that's happened here in the last few days laughter your big win to open your football season got  got some attention but i am always happy to be at a university that is doing such a superb job in preparing the next generation of students i had the great privilege of spea to your president dr genshaft thank you  and i will talk in a minute about some of what i've learned about usf and why i think a lot of what you do here is a model for what we need to do in higher education but for me it's exciting to be here with so many friends i want to start by than inaudible who just introduced me air force reservist former commander of the th aircraft maintenance squadron a woman who has served her country with honor and distinction i would be proud to be her commanderinchief  i want to thank your extraordinary mayor bob buckhorn  bob is an example of the kind of leader who gets things done by bringing people together setting big goals and wor to achieve them that's exactly what i want to do as president and i look forward to wor with bob and the people of this great city and region that includes a longe friend of mine state senator arthenia joyner  i have known arthenia long before she was in elec office but she's always been an activist always trying to make things better for people i've known her for  oh i hate to admit it   years laughter and i am so grateful she is my friend this is the countdown to one of the most important elections in our lifees no matter what your age this is going to determine so much about your futures the futures of our children and grandchildren the stakes could not be higher
 everyone knows what an important state florida is and it's not just because its always a hardfought state it's because florida shows all of the excitement the dynamism the opportunities as well as the challenges and problems that we have to face together so we have  days   days to make the case and i can't do it without you and i'm here  i'm here to lay out my case one more e and to ask for your help because every single vote counts our campaign set a goal in july we launched a drive to register three million amans to vote this election we have hos thousands of events across the country including right here in florida and today i'm as every one of you to give us some of your precious e to be part of this campaign and i'm going to run through some of the reasons why every single person here has a real stake in ma sure our country heads into the future with confidence and opism that we truly are stronger together because that's what will determine whether we have the economy that produces more good jobs with rising incomes whether we have an education system that prepares our young people for the jobs of the future whether college is affordable whether student debt can be paid back whether our health care system works whether we lead the world with strength and steadiness wor with allies and partners to make sure that we move toward peace and prosperity there is an exciting bold agenda before us but it cannot be done by any one person it must be done by all of us and that is something that   does not understand  among the many troubling things that were said at his convention  and honestly i somees didn't recognize what country they were tal about it was so dire so dark so divisive so dangerous but among the things he said was i alone can fix it  think of who that leaves out our men and women in uniform troops on the front line people like mary who put on the uniform of the air force to serve our country think about the police and firefighters who rushed toward danger think about those brave police officers and emergency responders in orlando when the pulse nightclub was attacked  think about all the teachers the educators the professors the staff who work to give young people a much better chance in the race of life think about all the hard wor people who can't build a house by themselves can't erect one of  's skyscrapers by themselves think of all the small businesses that take a big chance my dad was a small business man i know what a chance it is he couldn't do it alone he needed customers he needed suppliers he needed workers amans don't say i alone can fix it we say we'll fix it together just watch us nobody  nobody can solve problems better than we can
 and i want to be a president for all amans not some amans s s independents every single aman  i want to be a president for those who vote for me and those who vote against me because i want to bring our country together  i'm very proud that   and i are running a campaign of issues not insults  because i believe anybody who is as for your vote for the most important job not just in the country but in the world should tell you what they plan to do i do have this  i guess it's an old fashioned idea if you're going to ask people for their vote they ought to have some idea what they're voting for and i don't think it's enough to say oh i'll tell you later laughter i think it's important to lay it out and to tell you how it's going to be paid for and that's why starting today and especially for young people but really for everybody we are putting out a book it's called stronger together and in it  it shows this is more than a slogan for the campaign this is a blueprint for ama's future  among the things that we talk about is the core of our agenda as laid out in this book it is building an economy that works for everyone not just those at the top  we're going to make the biggest investment in new jobs since world war ii  infrastructure jobs like those here at the port our roads our bridges our tunnels our ports our airports they need work and there are millions of jobs to be done  and in addition to what you can see what about our water systems our sewer systems we need a new modern electric grid to be able to take in clean renewable energy that can then move us toward that future we see  i have a plan to install a half a ion solar panels by the end of my first term  and enough clean energy to power every home in ama by the end of my second term  and i want young people especially to be part of this to be in science technology engineering manufacturing creating this future that will determine the quality of your lives and the competitiveness of our economy we also have to finish extending broadband access to every place in ama  right now  percent of our teachers say that they assign homework to their students starting in elementary school they require the kids to learn how to use the internet i think that's great we want to have an internetsavvy population but here's the problem five million homes where little kids live where high school kids live don't have the internet what does that mean that means they're already behind it's so unfair we're going to make this economy grow but we're also going to make it fair we're going to have more advanced manufacturing jobs
 i think we made a mistake years ago when we elimina what used to be called vocational education  we've got to return technical education to our high schools our community colleges there are right now more than a million jobs that can be filled by people who are machinists computer designers tool and die makers but for whatever reason they haven't been given the chance to get that training and maybe they've been told you know what the only future is to go to a great university like usf well that is true for a lot of people but it's not true for everybody and we need to make the hard work that builds ama the kind of great work with respect and purpose that is going to attract a new generation  that's why you'll read what i want to do in here we're going to try to make community college free we're also going to have apprenticeship programs audio gap
 i'm going to give a tax credit to any company that is willing to pay a young person while that young inaudible parents made it's e for us to step up and build ama's future and let's make it fair while we do that that's why i've said we're going to emphasis the importance of small businesses right now small businesses are having a tough e in florida and across ama getting access to credit right and getting the kinds of regulations and overlapping expectations and standards that don't really make sense i want to make it clean and clear and i particularly want young people with an idea for a small business to feel that they can do it so i have proposed a moratorium for three years on student debt so you can actually get a business off the ground get it star make your future  i also believe we should raise the national minimum wage anybody wor full e should not be living in poverty  and finally let's guarantee equal pay for women's work which will raise family income  anyone who's willing to work hard should have enough money to raise a family did anybody of you watch any of the  convention  well i don't know if you saw these two young people years old from kansas young man young woman went to the e high school about to be seniors get a summer job wor in a pizza restaurant in their home town they're pretty exci i remember when i had what i thought of as my first real job not baby sitting not you know just kind of knoc around but a real job where i had to actually show up someplace and get a paycheck that was pretty exciting so a young man young woman were at our convention here's the story they told they were tal together one day after work they'd known each other and the young woman said you know i'm exci because i think i'm actually going to be able to save some money for college ma $ an hour and her friend the young man looked at her and he goes i'm ma $ an hour and the young woman said well you didn't have any experience before this job doing this did you he said no you know i didn't he sic said well what do you think happened the young man said oh it must be a mistake so they together and i give the young man a lot of credit  good guy right
 they go to tell the manager that there's been a mistake they're doing exactly the e job he's ma $ more an hour what happens the manager fired them both  and you know what that's legal if you find out about somebody else's salary even if you're doing exactly the e job you can be retalia against including being fired in most places so when i say let's have equal pay and some people i see loo quizzical at me they say well of course you've got to have equal pay well yeah if you're in the military and the pay scale is set or you're in the government and it's set or you're under a union contract and it's set but if you're in the vast majority of jobs in ama you have no idea whether you're being paid fairly so we can not let that continue that's wrong in ama if you're doing the job you deserve to get the pay  and so how are we going to fund this well i'll tell you we're going where the money is we're going to the people who've made the money in the last  years we're going to the top onetenth percent the millionaires the ionaires they're going to have to start paying for supporting our military supporting our education system supporting our health care system  there could not be a bigger contrast between what i've proposed when it comes to taxes and what   has proposed he actually has proposed giving trillions  and i mean that with a t  trillions in tax cuts to big corporations millionaires ionaires and wall street money managers  that would not only explode our national debt it would lead to massive cuts in education and health care and many of his proposals would really efit his own family but do nothing for the remaining plus percent of amans and in fact independent analysts have said this they've looked at our plans  he doesn't have much in the way of plans but they've looked at what he has said  and they've concluded if we did what  is recommending we would lose  million jobs in four years if we do what i'm recommending we stand to gain over  million jobs in the next four years  and among the things that i want to do is make sure we have an education system from early childhood through adulthood and that means i want universal prek i want to help more kids get a better start so that when they get to kindergarten and first grade they're ready to learn i want to work with our teachers and educators i respect teachers and educators and i want to give them the support they need to do the job we ask  and i want to support universities like this one now here's one of the reasons why fifty thousand students  percent on pell grants a lot of people would never have gotten an education if it weren't for the federal pell grant program right  but here's what's most impressive a lot of schools have a lot of pell grants this university graduates all categories of students at the e rate if you're a pell grant student a nonpell grant student if you're white africanaman latina a latino asian everybody graduates at the e rate
 and why that happens is because this university makes a particular commitment to every student and moves as quickly as possible to help kids who maybe are first generation college students right  i  you know i've got to tell you when i got to college  now my father went to college on a football scholarship i knew i wasn't going to college on a football scholarship laughter my mother had a really difficult childhood she never got to go to college so my dad couldn't really tell me much about going to college because he basically paid  played football for four years and loved it my mom couldn't tell me so when i got to college i felt so out of place i was so nervous there used to be something way back in the dark ages called collect phone calls laughter where you would call collect which meant that your parents had to pay for it and you just wai to see whether they'd accept it so i called home and i said i can't  i can't do this it's too hard everybody here is smarter than i am they're better prepared than i am i want to come home and my father who didn't want me to go so far away to school anyway he said come home laughter and my mother said no you have to stick it out and if you feel the e way at the end of the year then you can make a different decision of course my mother was right i loved it within a month or two but i know what it feels like to show up and wonder can you make it are you good enough are you smart enough and thank goodness usf has people waiting to mentor and reassure and guide students every single college and university needs to have that and then we've got to make it affordable so kids don't have to leave because they no longer have the funding that they need  and i want to do more in my effort to make childcare affordable no family should have to pay more than  percent of your income on childcare and right now you have a lot of states where it costs more for childcare than tuition at college and university so i'm going to do  i know you've got childcare here but as i told the president i want to do more to help you to make sure every student parent has a safe place to bring their child while they're studying and wor and trying to get their education and then we're going to help everybody with student debt how many of you have student debt  we're going to help you pay it back and pay it off quickly we're going to get the interest rates down we're going to give you new ways of paying it  because right now we have too may people laboring under student debt in a way that holds your own futures back so we're going to lift that burden off of you and we're also going to make sure you can get quality affordable health care every age you are every place you are we're going to get the costs down premiums copays deductibles and especially prescription drug costs  and there are two other things we're going to take on because i've heard about this all across ama we're going to take on helping more people with mental health and addiction problems get the help you need
 so i'm exci about what we can do to create an economy and education and health care system that works and while we do it we're going to be protecting the rights of amans all amans we have fought too hard we have come too far and that means civil rights and it means women's rights and gay rights and voter rights and workers rights and disability rights  and you know i believe with all my heart because i've done this work my entire life i was loo at the disability sign there my first job out of law school was with the children's defense fund i did a lot of interesting things and one of them was to gather evidence about why so many kids with disabilities were out of school there was no requirement that you went to school if you were blind deaf in a wheelchair and we changed the law the first nation in the world to do that and i am so proud of our country  so these rights are not for somebody else we all know somebody we all know a woman we all know somebody in a racial or ethnic minority we all know a worker or a voter we all know a gay person and we all know somebody with a disability these are our rights and the kinds of things that you've been hearing from   demeaning defaming groups of amans people who have every right to be respec by someone who wants to be president of the uni states and he stands there and mocks a reporter with a disability and he calls women pigs and he calls mexican immigrants rapists and criminals  and he demeans muslims and attacks a gold star family whose son died in action in iraq that's not who we are so yes we have a lot of plans but we also have values my friends and we're going to stand up for aman values  our book also outlines how we're going to keep our country safe from all threats we're going to work with our allies not insult them we're going to stand up to our adversaries not cozy up to them we're going to have real plans not claims and secret plans this november the aman people have a big choice to make when it comes to national security on the one hand we have   who has called the aman military a disaster  who disrespects our military leaders by saying and i quote i know more about isis than the generals do his companies  and listen to this because i know there are a lot of veterans and a lot of you know active duty people based here in tampa his companies   companies have fired veterans because they had to take e off to fulfill their military commitments
 and we all saw him disparage the khans a gold star family who lost their son in a car bomb explosion in iraq as he ran toward it to prevent the loss of life of people in his unit and saving hundreds of his fellow soldiers and when asked why he would insult a gold star family he sugges that his sacrifices are somehow comparable to theirs because he said and again i quote audio gap
 we're going to bolster our defenses including with an intelligence surge to protect us and our allies we will do whatever is necessary for as long as it takes to bring isis to justice and end their reign of terror once and for all  and i will tell you this i am a very patient person i don't quit i don't give up i don't blink this sunday will be the th anniversary of the attack of / i was a senator from new york i knew people who were killed i worked with families and the few survivors i worked to get the health care needed by our first responders and emergency workers who ran toward danger  i worked to make our country safer and to rebuild new york and the pentagon but i always always was determined to do anything i could to bring bin laden to justice  and thanks to the very patient painsta work of the aman intelligence community finally when i was secretary of state we were given the opportunity to evaluate the best evidence we had seen in a long e and i was honored to be part of that small group in the situation room advising president  as we went through the evidence over and over and over again trying to decide was it credible enough strong enough to take action and if we did what kind of action would it be a missile strike would it be a bombing would it be an attack by special forces and when it came e to go around the table these were all extremely experienced thoughtful experts we all gave our opinions i was one who said i thought it was worth the risk and i was  and i was in that small situation room on that day you all know the story some of you read the book some of you have seen the movies but there's one thing i want to tell you because it demonstrates again what our values are as amans remember   has said he would order aman troops to torture he would order aman troops to murder family members of terrorists that's what he has said heedless of the consequences that that would lead to in terms of putting amans all over the world at even greater risk here's what happened that night in pakistan this is not an often told part of the story so i want to tell you particularly the young people here particularly active duty and military veterans like mary if you saw any of the reenactment you know that one of the helicopters clipped its tail as it was going into the courtyard on the wall
 it disabled that helicopter now thankfully every contingency had been thought through and so we were prepared for that the military was prepared they could get another helicopter there to take out the seals who were going to have to blow up the disabled helicopter after rushing into the compound ta out the two body guards ta out bin laden's adult son ta out bin laden they knew they had to get out of there at any e there could have been pakistani military wondering what's going on something's happening this was a military garrisoned town so e was really precious and here's what the seals did before they blew that helicopter up they took out all the women and children family members of terrorists including the worst terrorist of all they took them out of the compound around the back to safety before they blew that helicopter up that   is what aman honor looks like  i want to mention just three other threats one threat here right at home  the epidemic of gun violence and we have got to have comprehensive background checks close the gun show loophole close the online loophole and the ability of people on the terrorist watch list buying a gun in ama this agenda i've just briefly outlined is suppor by a vast majority of amans and a vast majority of aman gun owners and it's e we all said in one voice hey we can respect the second amendment we can respect the right to own arms but we don't want people who shouldn't have guns in the first place killing anybody else ever again  another threat to our country is climate change  was the hottest year on record and the science is clear it's real it's ree havoc on communities across ama last week's hurricane was another reminder of the devastation that extreme weather can cause and i send my thoughts and prayers to everyone affec by hermine but this is not the last one that's going to hit florida given what's happening in the climate nobody knows that better than folks right here in tampa and in the broader region sea levels have been rising here about an inch per decade since the s at the rate we are going by  which is not that far away $ ion of coastal property in this state will be flooding at high tide and whenever our infrastructure is threatened so too is our homeland security the next president will have to work with communities like tampa's to prepare for future storms
 when i'm in the oval office i'm going to work with local leaders to make smart investments in infrastructure to help protect regions from flooding and other effects of climate change i'm going to continue to work on the international and national level to try to turn the clock back to stabilize and reduce emissions even more to try to gain more e but we're going to have to begin wor immediately on mitigation and resilience and prevention as well  and what about   well he doesn't even believe in climate change he says it's a hoax inven by the chinese and he says quote you can't get hurt with extreme weather now this is the e guy who at one of his golf courses in some coastal place has demanded that a seawall be built to protect his golf course from rising tides so it's all fine if it affects  but if affects the rest of nity he could care less if it affects people who lose their homes or their businesses that took a lifee to build doesn't matter to him when it comes to protecting our country against natural disasters and the threat of climate change once again   is totally unfit and unqualified to be our president  and let's not forget the next president also has to keep our country safe from public health crises like zika it's painfully obvious we can't rely on the  congress or  governors to fund an adequate response  they can't help themselves from playing games even when lives are on the line i call on all s to put people before politics and finally vote in favor of a clean funding  to fight zika right here in florida  but the failure of the s in congress including your  senator means that we can't always count on them can we so last month i announced that as president i will create a public health rapid response fund to be available when emergencies occur to have a consistent budget to better enable government agencies at all levels to quickly respond to major public health crises and pandemics
 this will complement our efforts to prepare our country to deal with those challenges and because of climate change we're going to have more of them because of mobility around the world you can get on a plane in africa and bring ebola to the uni states you could be a mosquito in brazil and make your way to florida we've got to be better prepared it's always better to invest a penny in the frontend than to have to pay many dollars after the crisis has already occurred  that's why it is e that when we talk about protecting public health to put politics aside and put our people's needs first now i'm exci about doing all of this with you for you on your behalf but i can't do it without you and here's what i'm as the deadline to register voters is october th if any of you are not registered or you're not sure you are registered or you're a student and you're registered somewhere else but it would be more convenient to vote here you have until october th so please learn how to register you can go to iwillvotecom and learn how to do that you can go to my website com and learn how to do that we are also building volunteer teams so you can get involved by going to com or text join join to  or you can sign up here today are there people with clipboards somewhere around here on the way out i guess you can sign up here today to have a volunteer registration shift and you can also apply if you're really interes to our get out the vote fellowship program we're going to organize special groups to get people to the polls and we need you this state has so much promise and i want to be the best president that you could possibly have in florida i want to work on all of these issues everything that's in this blueprint that we have published and i want particularly to give the young people of this university this state this country the best shot you can have to be part of the aman dream however you define that many of us  many of us who came before know that there were barriers in the way when i was a young woman there were schools i couldn't go to jobs i couldn't get scholarships i wasn't eligible for just because i was a woman and a lot of those barriers have been knocked down for every african aman latino asian aman native aman gay aman you know that barriers have been knocked down but they're not all down and we've got to make sure they're all gone and that no demagogue can ever bring them back and can ever exploit the fears and insecurities of the aman people  so please vote this year like your future depends on it because it does and if you give me the great honor of serving as your president i will get up every single day in that white house and i will work my heart out for those better jobs better educational opportunities better health care with quality and affordability protecting our rights protecting our country unifying ama
 because we need to be the uni states not the divided states of ama  and yes remember as that sign over there says i believe this too love s hate let's have a future that proves that's true thank you all god bless you   presidential candidate delivers remarks following election results new york city

 my wife anne and i are so proud of    i'm proud of   because she has been and is a great history maker in every thing that she has done as a civil rights lawyer and first lady of arkansas and first lady of this country and senator and secretary of state
 she has made history in a nation that is good at so many things but that has made it uniquely difficult for women to be elec to federal office she became the first major party nominee as a woman to be president and last night won the popular vote of amans for the president  that is an amazing accomplishment it is an amazing accomplishment i'm proud of   because in the words of langston hughes she's held fast to dreams she was inspired at a young age to an epiphany that if families and children do well that's the best barometer of whether society does well in everything she's done she's focused on that we know she would have made history as a president in one sense but we never have had a president who's made their whole career about the empowerment of families and children and i was as exci about that in the oval office as i was exci to have my friend  there and make history as the first woman president i'm exci and proud of  because she has built such a wonderful team there is a  there's a beautiful and kind of comical parable in the new testament about a vineyard owner who hires people to work and says i'm going to pay you this for a full day then he hires people at noon i'm going to pay you the e thing for the half day then he hires people one hours work i'm going to pay you the e and those who star earlier in the day said hold on we don't like this that you're treating everybody who came late just as well as you're treating us i'm going to tell you something here's what i've come to know so well about  the team that she has assembled over the years of people that are so deeply loyal to her because she's so deeply loyal to them is inspiring but i've seen that e degree of loyalty and compassion and sensitivity extended to the most recent folks who have joined the team the folks who came to the vineyard with just one hour to go her loyalty and compassion of  and  to people if you're with you you're with you and that is just something so remarkable and finally i'm proud of  because she loves this country  nobody  nobody had to wonder about   whether she would accept an outcome of an election in our beautiful democracy nobody had to ask that question nobody had to doubt it she knows our country for what it is she knows the system that we have and its warts and blemishes she's deeply in love with it and accepts it she's been in battles before where if it didn't go her way she accep it but then woke up the next day and battled again for the dreams that she's held fast to and that love of country is something that i think is obvious to everybody obvious to everyone i want to thank   for as anne and i to join this wild ride we  about a week before she asked if i would be her running mate anne and i went up to westchester and we sat down with  and  and with  and mark and with charlotte and aiden for about three hours of conversation to try to determine whether we would be the right people to be on the ticket and when we got in the car to head back to the airport after the three hour discussion i said to anne honey i don't know whether we're going to be on this ticket or not but i do know this we're going to remember that three hours for the rest of our life and now we've  we'll remember  days that we've had with this fantastic couple of public servants and all of you for the rest of our life i'll just say this  and i know well the wisdom and the words of william faulkner he said they kilt us but they ain't whupped us yet  they kilt us but they ain't whupped us yet because we know that the work remains we know that the dreams of empowering families and children remain and in that work that important work that we have to do as a nation it is so comforting even at a tough e to know that   is somebody until her very last breath is going to be battling for the values that make this nation great and the values that we care so deeply about
